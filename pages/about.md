## Philippine Food History Project

Philippine food and beverage have a fascinating and ongoing story reaching into prehistory. These exhibits celebrate how Filipinos have been creatively selecting preferred ingredients, technologies, procedures, and flavors amidst transitioning social, religious, political, economic, and scientific conditions. They are a testament to the value of heritage side by side with an appreciation for the contemporary.
