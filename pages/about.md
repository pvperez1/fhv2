## About Felice Prudente Sta. Maria

Felice Prudente Sta. Maria is the originator of the Philippine Food History website. She is an internationally awarded non-fiction author, cultural heritage advocate, and pioneer in Philippine food history specialising in the Spanish and American colonial eras.

“Cultural action is civic action,” has been her mantra well before the concept of cultural nationalism emerged. Because food can stimulate widespread popular discourse, Sta. Maria seeks out its roles in nurturing sustainable food security, nourishing interpersonal relations, enriching intrapersonal philosophy, and fortifying trans-generational inspiration.

She served as a commissioner on the Philippine National Commission for Culture and the Arts, 1992-1995 and UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines, 1992-2012, as well as a trustee of the Philippine National Museum, 2010-2016. She was president, 1986-1992 and then vice chairman for cultural relations 1992-1995 of Metropolitan Museum of Manila where she promoted a bilingual program of Art for All emphasizing educational activities.

She was a culture page columnist for The Manila Times, 1986-1989, Sunday opinion page columnist for Philippine Star, 1989-1995, and food columnist for Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2002-2003.

She is currently on the board of advisers at Ayala Museum, and is a vice president and co-founder of Food Writers Association of the Philippines.

## Philippine Food History Project

This website consolidates research about Philippine cuisine derived from written sources starting in the 13th through the mid-20th centuries of the Common Era.

Much of the information was originally shared on Instagram [@felicepstamaria](https://www.instagram.com/felicepstamaria/) starting in 2019. Papers, PowerPoint presentations, vintage recipes, and other material about Filipino food history are being added.

The website seeks to provide culinary enthusiasts and food heritage advocates with data from which they can pursue their own interdisciplinary research into how gastronomy developed in the Philippines and continues to innovate toward contemporary sustainability.

Evidence unknown at the time of postings can revise published theories and conjectures. New discoveries in archival and library collections, archaeological excavations, and DNA-based analysis can revise food history. The website originator humbly apologises for any short-comings and mistakes beyond our control.
