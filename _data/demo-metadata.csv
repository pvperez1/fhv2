coll001,Food to Sail Around the World,,,"Five ships were selected to be the Armada de Maluco. Their destination was Maluco, also called the Spice Islands of today's Indonesia. Trinidad was the flagship with around 61 men to feed including Ferdinand Magellan, the fleet's chief. San Antonio the largest by tonnage had 57 men, the Concepcion where Sebastian Elcano was assigned had a crew of 44, the Victoria had 44, and the smallest ship the Santiago had 31. Daily rations were computed for 237 persons although the actual number sailing is uncertain because manifests are not identical. The food was to last two years. The fleet left on August 10, 1519. They should have food to last till August 9, 1521. Only the Victoria skippered by Elcano returned on September 6, 1522. Only 18 of the original voyagers survived. Hunger and starvation were enemies of all voyages, especially a voyage of exploration such as that of the Armada de Maluco.",Armada de Maluco; Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Trinidad; San Antonio; Concepcion; Victoria; Santiago; Spice Islands; Indonesia,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative currency.,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LySqMGA0PAlq1gHp6FhXnLgs2EQTbCsp,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LySqMGA0PAlq1gHp6FhXnLgs2EQTbCsp,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LySqMGA0PAlq1gHp6FhXnLgs2EQTbCsp,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM0vJi-Hxi8/

coll003,Holy Week Abstinence,,,"The expedition to the Spice Islands with Magellan in command experienced Holy Weeks in 1520, 1521, and 1522. Conforming to the Catholic rituals was important to the crew. Their lives were constantly in peril, especially from storms and hunger. The first Palm Sunday was 8 months into their provisions to last 2 years. They had anchored at St. Julian port in Argentina where autumn was starting in the Southern Hemisphere. The geese and sea-wolves they hunted as fresh food were penguins and seals, respectively. In 1521, Palm Sunday was at Homonhon Island, Samar form where on Holy Monday they sailed south. By Good Friday, March 29 according to Pigafetta's reckoning, they were in Mazaua (Limasawa) of Southern Leyte. Their Easter Sunday was celebrated with a meal of two swine given by Datus Colambu and Siauri. The meal was cooked on board. The last Holy Week (with Elcano now skippering the Victoria) found them somewhere in the Indian Ocean where on April 16 they headed north to Africa. Modern calculations identify March 26, 1522 as Easter Sunday. There was no feasting. The men were suffering inanition and catabolysis: the effects of extreme starvation. Whatever provisions they had loaded in Tidore, the center for clove, had deteriorated or been consumed. Their Philippine Holy Week, with Magellan still alive, was the friendliest of their foreign Easters.","Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Antonio Pigafetta; Datu Colambu; Datu Siauri; Spice Islands; Argentina; Homonhon Island, Samar; Limasawa; Mazaua; Leyte; Tidore",Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative collectible for the Quincentennial,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM_ZNI7HlgC/
coll004,Too Little,,,"The Magellan expedition was one of discovery. It sought a maritime route from the Atlantic via South America into the Spice Islands. There was enough salted and dried food for two years that constantly needed replenishment of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, potable water, and firewood. Sailors recognised hunger, scurvy, and beriberi as enemies just like storms and shipwreck. Magellan sensing a long journey, decreased daily rations as allowed legally. In December 1519, four months into the provisions some men grumbled and asked to increase their food. Magellan appealed to their loyalty to the Crown and appeased them. He reminded that they had been finding abundant fresh food since they had left Spain. But the next year on the night of Palm Sunday April 1 , 1520 some officers mutinied! They seized three of the boats, then ransacked and distributed food to the crew hoping to win their loyalty for a trip back to Spain. They were 8 months into the journey. Two leaders were executed and two other instigators exiled to Patagonia. Forty of the crew were not executed because they were needed to sail the ships. One ship got wrecked and it seems its provisions went down with the boat although the crew survived. They transferred to the remaining four boats that stretched their food to accommodate them. By August 1520 the armada had reached the midway point of their stored provisions. In November of 1520, Magellan discovered the passage that led to the unknown Pacific Ocean. The San Antonio deserted and returned to Spain. Magellan should have had 8 months of food left when the remaining 3 ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on November 28, 1520. But they did not expect the vastness of the Pacific they were discovering for Europe. They survived by eating rats, the main yard cover made of ox hide, and sawdust from the ship's boards. They were unable to fish in the deep waters. The provisions had spoiled and ran out during the 3 months and 20 days it took them to reach Guam.",Ferdinand Magellan; Armada de Maluco; Guam; Spain; Spice Islands; Patagonia; mutiny,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Magellan coin.,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNB4DMRHEYp/
coll005,Out of Food,,,"Calculating exactly how many men arrived on three ships at Homonhon Island in 1521 is complicated. There could have been roughly 130 men for Magellan to find new water and food for. The peaceful strategies were firstly, to fish, hunt and forage at uninhabited islands or places where islanders allowed them to. The swine eaten at Homonhon Island may have been hunted there. No mention is made if they were carried from Guam. A second means is to receive food as gifts. The 9 men from Samar’s Suluan Island, the first of ancestral Filipinos to encounter the Spanish Armada, gave fish, 2 coconuts, assorted banana, and a jar of native wine from their supplies. One suspects the Europeans could not have fattened up in the 10 days from the time they secured food in Guam to the time they met the Suluans. The natives could have recognised the look of sailors who had suffered extreme hunger. The third means is to barter for food. The Suluans returned after 4 days with rice, chicken and other foodstuff which were paid for with beads, caps, textiles, clothing and other goods. But the ships carried only a finite amount of trade items and they were needed to purchase spices in Maluco, their ultimate destination.",Suluan Island; Cruxificion,Magellan Menu,,,CRUCIFIXION by Juan Flandes. 1519.

coll006,When Negotiations Failed,,,"When peaceful means failed to secure provisions, many sailors turned aggressive. Ships and villages were raided for supplies. Hostages were ransomed for food. In Cebu, Magellan required a food quota for chiefs loyal to Rajah Humabon. Humabon, the Captain’s blood brother, had pledged allegiance to the Spanish King. He was expected to assist the royal armada. When one village refused to give its quota, Magellan burned it. Such terrorist tactics were an underlying cause for the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu spurned the order. He fought to protect his people and their right to food security. Political competition among local chiefs was likely not his sole motive. Antonio Pigafetta was from the Republic of Venice, a rival in the spice trade. The passenger manifesto does not name him. It lists an Antonio Lombardo, Lombardy being within Spain’s Italian realm. He was among those added legally beyond the passenger cut off. A papal ambassador likely helped Pigafetta get on board for the adventure of a lifetime.",Rajah Humabon; Magellan; Basilica of Santi Nazaro e Celso; Lombardy; Antonio Pigafetta;,Magellan Menu,,,"The AVEROLDI POLYPTYCH.

coll007,Restocking,,,"Renaissance food preservation for naval voyages was limited to mostly dried, salted and dried, or brined foods.  Replenishing fresh supplies including water was mandatory for survival. Fresh foods the circumnavigation crew found in the Philippines included some familiar to them like pigs and chickens.  The domesticated varieties were usually prestige foods used in pagan rituals for thanksgiving and when requesting bountiful food, safe childbirth, and healing.  The crew of mixed European ethnicities also found familiar fish, crab, goat, citruses, bananas, honey, salt, ginger, garlic, rice, millet, panicum and sorghum. Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique would have known the foods of Insular Southeast Asia. Pigafetta from Vicenza seems to have tried coconut for the first time. He wrote of its uses as wine, vinegar, oil, water, milk and a substitute for bread. Although rice was cooked in a clay pot above fire as in Spain, rice was also cooked in a bamboo tube placed under fire.  He found cakes wrapped in leaves, some of rice and others of millet.  One rice cake was called tinapay, according to him. Other foods he and his mates may have found unusual were bat meat, turtle eggs and tabon eggs. He heard about a delicacy called Laghan Snails found attached to the hearts of dead whales. Like explorers over the millennia and even today, the Armada’s crew had to eat whatever would keep them alive.",Philippines; Antonio Pigafetta; Laghan Snails,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Coin,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNRMIH1nxAR/
coll008,Pig and Peacock,,,"The special meal for visitors in Cebu as in much of Insular Southeast Asia was an all-meat menu. Pigafetta and comrades ate 35 different meats including peacock during a welcome meal sent to them by the Bornean Sultan.  For their audience with him, they were fetched by elephants. One wonders what was served at the farewell meal hosted by Humabon in Cebu after Magellan’s death.  He invited the crew and said he would give them the gold jewelry they knew he had had crafted for the Spanish King.  The new Armada leader wanted to secure from Humabon guides who knew the route to the Moluccas. The meal turned out to be a trap and almost everyone who went was massacred. Pigafetta had been wounded in the face by an arrow and was swollen, so could not go.  The three ships left immediately. One wonders if the Armada would have gotten to the Spiceries quicker than they had if Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique were with them. Magellan had likely reached Mindanao from Portuguese territories when he was still a soldier-sailor for the country of his birth. No one knows with certainty what was Enrique’s fate. Wanting freedom, did he plan the massacre with Humabon? Others suggest he was killed because he wore Spanish garments and would have been mistaken for one. Was Lapulapu in with the plot? No one knows for sure.

coll009,Nearby Brunei,,,"The Armada de Maluco, having escaped from Cebu, scuttled one ship in Bohol because there were not enough men left to sail her. Magellan died in April so did not experience the crew’s first stop at a Muslim settlement. It was on July 9 that several  canoes accompanying a beautiful prau with 8 elderly chiefs and musicians in it approached them. The prau decorated in gold flew from its bow blue and white banners topped by peacock feathers. Each of the two Spanish ships was presented with a wooden jar covered in yellow silk and filled with betelnut chew and orange blossoms.  Two cages with fowl, several goats, bundles of sugarcane, and three jars of distilled rice wine as clear as water were also given.  Six days later a spectacle of three praus with musicians playing drums and gongs came with foods made only of rice, some wrapped in leaves, some shaped like loaves, and others made like tarts with eggs and honey. The Armada gave presents to the 7 chiefs and herald in the group and sent through them gifts for the king, queen, and governor. They had reached Borneo led by Rajah Siripada.",Armada de Maluco; Borneo; Rajah Siripada,Magellan Menu,,,Borneo chart.

coll010,Courtly Food,,,"The Armada’s officials were allowed by Borneo’s Rajah Siripada to load water, fresh food and firewood. They presented gifts during an audience at court. When done they were served refreshments that included clove and cinnamon. The spices were known by Filipino ancestors but not noticed in their cuisine by Pigafetta. The Armada officials proceeded to the house of Siripada’s governor where they ate a full meal. Nine men arrived, each carrying a large wooden tray from the king. Each tray had 10-12 porcelain dishes filled with veal, capon, chicken, peacock, fish and other animal meat. All in all there were 30-32 different kinds of meat in addition to fish. Rice and sweet foods were included along with gold spoons like those in Europe for the guests’ use. Distilled wine was drank in porcelain cups the size of an egg. Pigafetta recorded nothing as elaborate at any of the courts in Philippine waters. ctto Vintage postal image of a peacock.

coll011,Life-Saving Clove,,,"On July 29, 1521 the Armada’s 2 ships escaped from Borneo! They feared being trapped and captured several Bornean trading junks. On one was Siripada’s captain-general feared throughout the region. He was the “son of the King of Luzon” and got away with the junks by bribing with gold the Armada’s new commander Johan Carvalho who was replaced subsequently. The prince would have been Muslim. The only Muslim community spotted by the Armada in Philippine waters was at Cagayan Island: a small population banished from Borneo. The Bornean experience served them well when they finally reached the Moluccas. On November 8, 1521 they entered the harbor of one Spice Island, Tidore. Its ruler Rajah Sultan Manzor became their patron. He filled the ships with clove, provided guides who knew the Laut Chidol (South Sea), and helped provision the Armada for its trip back to Spain.

coll012,Insular Asian Foods,,,"Pigafetta and the men of the Armada expanded their tastes of Insular Southeast Asian foods while loading clove at Tidore Island. Its leader Rajah-Sultan Manzor became their patron. Pigafetta learned of labu (possibly a wild cucumber), calama (rhubarb), itich (gander), ansa (goose). At Buru (the third largest island of the Moluccas) he recorded chanali (a delicacy of banana, Javanese almond and honey wrapped in leaves). Back in Tidore, Pigafetta discovered “wooden bread”. It was the sole (or principal) provision of island sailors he explained. He described it as made of “soft wood,” actually the pith of a palm covered in thorns. The soft wood was also known as saghu. There is no mention if wooden bread would be carried on the journey to Spain. There was no sea biscuit, the hard and double baked wheat bread that European mariners depended on. Their expedition had been teaching them about Asian food, psyche, and social relations. ctto Commemorative Lapulapu medal minted by the Philippine Central Bank.",Antonio Pigafetta; Rajah-Sultan Manzor; Tidore Island,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Lapulapu medal minted by the Philippine Central Bank.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN1YKphHtS4/
coll013,Extreme Hunger Notwithstanding,,,"In preparation for the trip to Seville, the 2 ships stocked bamboo tubes taller than a person filled with drinking water. They may have had goats, but certainly no pork since they were in an Islamic sultanate. Maybe they carried unripe bananas, coconuts, rice, sagho, dried fish. Only the Victoria would continue on. The Trinidad, suddenly leaking badly, would attempt to retrace the Pacific and South American route after making repairs. Meanwhile, the winds were favourable to sail west. On February 11, 1522 Victoria left Timor, the last island with fresh supplies. As they crossed from the South Sea to Africa, as Pigafetta wrote: because they had no salt their food putrified. If Portuguese spotted them, their clove and maps would be confiscated. They would all be taken prisoners. After 9 weeks rounding the Cape of Good Hope in tempestuous seas they reached the Atlantic Ocean. They had broken a mast and were leaking. Being in waters where it was legal for them, they stopped at a Portuguese port on Cape Verde Islands for food feigning they had been exploring Spanish America and were heading home. The ruse worked but not for long. Leaving 13 of their men still ashore, Elcano and all who had remained aboard sailed off to avoid the Portuguese sure to give chase. When the Victoria reached Spain on September 6, 1522 only 18 of the 237 original crew who began the trip on August 10, 1519 were alive. Of the 13 natives from Tidore who helped navigate only 4 made it. Sebastian Elcano, a Basque native, had brought the Victoria home. They had completed the first circumnavigation against all odds: an unknown route, bad weather, mutiny, warring natives, fear of the unknown, sickness, and prolonged hunger. Humanity was victorious. ctto Commemorative coin featuring the Victoria.",Victoria; Trinidad; Antonio Pigafetta; Sebastian Elcano,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative coin featuring the Victoria.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN3lbT1HfBf/

coll015,When Bread Meant Rice Cake,,,"Tinapay, today’s Filipino word for wheat bread, originally meant “a certain kind of rice cake.” We owe that fact to Pigafetta who in 1521 listed words in the Cebuano area and their meanings. He did not describe tinapay so no one knows what it really was. Did he not encounter other rice cakes, what we call kakanin now? Missionaries of the later 1500s used tinapay as the word for host when explaining it to new native converts. In the 1800s, tinapay was described by the Recollect priest Juan Felix De Encarnación as a flour circle with a sweet filling that was folded in half to resemble the moon. Perhaps because it resembled the circular host, tinapay was selected by pioneering missionaries. They also used tinapay for wheat bread when referring to miracles of Jesus Christ such as feeding a multitude with just a few fish and bread loaves. Filipinos did not know wheat or wheat bread at the time. They were brought by the Spanish. Later “hostia” was introduced as the word for host; tinapay stayed as generic for wheat bread. Many words around the world change meanings in small and big ways.",Bread; Pan,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3YIpd2nAJm/
coll016,Where did Pigafetta Discover Millet in the Philippines?,,,"In 1521 Pigafetta recorded that miglio (millet in Italian) was called HUMAS at the Visayan island of Mazaua where food included citrus, rice, coconut, and more. While Limasawa in southern Leyte is considered to be Mazaua, a case has been made that it might actually have been Masao, in the Caraga area of Mindanao! Historians are debating the evidence again. Millet was likely the fall-back cereal during drought when rice would not grow. Today humas is better known as KABOG, actually the word for fruit bat. It seems fruit bats eat millet and in northern Cebu’s town of Catmon, rice cake of millet is called BUDBUD KABOG. There is even an annual budbud kabog festival every February 10.

Pigafetta wrote that his co-crew were always invited by the Cebuanos to eat and drink with them, whether day or night. “Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They drink frequently and copiously from the jars through those small reeds,” Pigafetta wrote.

He had distinguished himself in the Portuguese military and maritime service, even reaching Malacca under Alfonso d’Albuquerque who sought to expand the Portuguese empire. Magallanes was no stranger to Asia when he got to the Philippines in 1521. He would have known bananas, coconuts, and other foods that a European crew could live on when food loaded in Spain ran out.

But he doesn’t reveal if the roasting was done on a spit, using something like a barbecue stick or skewer, or laid on a grill that might have been made of wood. Roasting is an early, basic cooking technique. One only needs an open fire to roast. RP archaeological sites in Tawi Tawi and Butuan, areas within the scope of Pigafetta’s voyage had remains of cooked food, likely roasted, as far back as 7,000 years ago and the 11th and 12th centuries of the Common Era, respectively.

Pigafetta recorded that at the time there was not only roasting but, in earthenware pots, cooking. Perhaps the broths with fish or pork were made in them. But he also recorded cooking in bamboo tubes. Broths can be cooked in them as well in shells. Pigafetta preferred the rice cooked in bamboo to that cooked in a pot. He wrote that leaves were used as a pot liner when rice was cooked. In Cebu tagnáwan tree leaves were known in the 19th century to serve the purpose. One wonders if they may have been used because Pigafetta knew banana leaves but did not say they lined pots. In the Philippines the earliest earthenware so far found by the Philippine National Museum is 7,340 years old and from Tawi-Tawi.

coll028,Pigafetta’s Elephant Ride,,,"In addition to roasting and cooking in a clay pot, Pigafetta identified a third cooking procedure practised in 1521: baking. It is first mentioned as the way cakes of rice and millet wrapped in leaves were made. The cakes were part of the ritual to consecrate a pig for sacrifice. Likely the thickly wrapped cakes were baked inside mounds of hot ash, even the remains of fires used for roasting. (The beehive oven was introduced much later.) While sailing in southern waters he arrived at Borneo. On June 15, 1521 three praus from there brought foods including rice wrapped in leaves. Some resembled sugar loaves in size and shape; others were somewhat longish. There was also rice made in the manner of tarts using egg and honey. He was fetched later by 2 elephants with silk trappings to bring him to and from the Borneo king. The elephants were preceded by a dozen men carrying porcelain jars covered with silk and containing the crew’s gifts. Borneo is really close geographically to the Philippines. One wonders if it is true that the Sultan of Sulu had elephants, their 2 progenitors a gift from the ruler of Java that is also nearby. Dwarf elephants lived on Luzon 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago.

It is only when he gets to Borneo that he mentions being served refreshments of cloves and cinnamon. He finds the best cinnamon growing, though, on “the island of Butuan and Calaghan” and after leaving Visayan islands for good, finds cloves in 5 islands making up the Moluccas. But residents of the Visayas knew the spices the Portuguese bought. In Cebuano, Pigafetta records MANISSA for pepper, CHIANCHE for clove, MANA for cinnamon.

coll030,A Taste of Visayan Food,,,"The first circumnavigation crew would have satisfied their tastebud cravings the way Visayans did. One of Pigafetta’s most important observations is that the natives knew natural fermentation: coconut vinegar and alcoholic beverages of coconut, nipa, and rice. Before fermentation, tuba was sweetish. Along with honey, ripe fruits, and fresh sugarcane juice one’s sweet tooth could be satisfied. Tastebuds are warning devices of the human body, alerting when there is not enough or a surfeit of a taste that could cause sickness, even emotional imbalance. Sourness came from the coconut vinegar and native lemon. Salty was satisfied by salt. In fact Pigafetta found some dishes too salty. What could have been bitter? Charred meat as well as cinnamon and clove if they chewed on them. Maybe foraged fruits and leaves? Umami desire was satisfied by savory, “proteiny” cooked meats and meaty broths. No tastebud has been found reacting only and specifically to piquancy, so it is considered a mouth feel. Raw garlic and ginger provided the pricking to perk up a meal. Even if Pigafetta likely left out describing other culinary experiences, what he did describe celebrates how Filipinos used their surroundings to satisfy tastebuds, hunger and the dream of a good meal.

Word spread it was best to feed the foreigners and let them be off on their quest. On July 29, 1521 (3 months after Magallanes died), Pigafetta's colleagues captured a feared captain-general of the Bornean king. He turned out to be the son of the ""king of Luzon.""

Other foods specified by Pigafetta are almonds, sweet and tasty pomegranates, watermelons, wild cucumbers, gourds, and comulicai similar to a large cucumber. He made a vocabulary of ""words spoken by Moro people in the area"" (also called ""A Malay Vocabulary"") noting they had only been there for the last 50 years having pushed the indigenous peoples upland to where the clove trees grow wild. In central Philippines he listed as food ""roots like turnips"" but he had no word for them. In the vocabulary he calls them ubi.

Certain filaments in the husk make a cord with which to bind native boats. Under the husk is a hard shell thicker than a walnut's that is burned and made into a useful powder. [Medicinal] Under that shell is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness eaten fresh with meat and fish as if it were bread. It tasted like almond to him; he explained it could be dried and eaten, too. In the middle of the marrowy substance is a clear, sweet, refreshing water. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. He described making a butter-like oil by boiling coconut marrow and water that had putrefied (fermented). When they wish to make vinegar, they let pure coconut water ferment under the sun. He learned to make coconut milk by scraping the marrow, mixing it with its own water, then straining it through cloth. He was told one tree could live to be a hundred years old.

One ate coconut meat chunks or rice cooked as solid as bread. Rice was the desired cereal, a food eaten in Spain and Italy because Moors from the Near East had cultivated it when they ruled Spain. Everywhere there was swine, goat, poultry, fish. One had to carry them live and slaughter as needed. The crew did not have salt to preserve the cuts while they sailed, he wrote. All around the region were coconut, banana, possibly also sugarcane. Praus bartered firewood needed for cooking on board. Water could be bought in long bamboo tubes that needed to be stored upright. One needed attractive fabrics, hats, clothing, glass beads, and metal to exchange for food. Otherwise one used kidnapping for ransom, storming small villages, and capturing laden boats to secure food. The easterly winds they had been waiting for were blowing but they were unsure how to get home. Portuguese knew the route but they were the enemy and needed to be avoided at all costs.

It was believed the banana caused humankind’s damnation (not the apple) and that Adam dressed in its leaves giving it another term, CALZONES or BRAGAS DE ADÁN, Adam’s underpants. It is claimed Spanish knew the banana before the 1492 voyage of Columbus. Arabs may have brought the banana from its cradle of origin, the Eastern Indies to Europe.

coll037,Pigafetta Postlude,,,"Pigafetta's published eyewitness story about the first voyage around the world provides Philippine food writers with a baseline for ingredients and cooking procedures. His snippets also noted there was no great emperor lording over insular Southeast Asia; island kings fought each other even after intermarriage among their families; trade was an important factor for peace and political power; food was traded and given as gifts; feasting together could be a sign of friendship or a means to poison or hack away at guests. There was no campaign to make pagans Muslim. In Tidore, the crew killed all swine on board they had been keeping for food to please the Muslim King, their partner for securing clove and some nutmeg in the Moluccas. He gave them goats and poultry in exchange. It was known in the area and respected that Muslims did not like the looks and smells of pork. The provisions from Asia ran out. All the men on the carrack ""Victoria"" were starving as they reached Africa, but they refused to stop at Portuguese centres for food lest they be captured. The 18 who made it back to Sanlucar and Seville were emaciated. Their captain, Juan Sebastian Elcano (1476-1526), was rewarded by the king with gold ducats and a personal crest bearing the singular motto: Primus circumdedisti me.

coll038,Coconut Came First,,,"The Philippine vinegar first documented in a publication was the kind made of coconut. Pigafetta described it in March 1521. He explained how coconut water is naturally fermented, then placed in the sun till it becomes vinegar that to him resembled white wine. He also documented that Filipinos made wine (tuba) from both coconut and nipa palms. Vinegar is wine turned sour, so maybe there was also nipa vinegar but he did NOT write about it. So coconut vinegar is the earliest Philippine vinegar according to historical evidence. The image is the cover of a cookbook published in 1914 by the USA company, Franklin Baker Coconut Company, that in the 1920s would start the desiccated coconut export business of the Philippines, still worth millions.",Coconut; Coconut water,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XUlH_CaTTJMRaQzKtZf35Cfpos5HR3Ly,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XUlH_CaTTJMRaQzKtZf35Cfpos5HR3Ly,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XUlH_CaTTJMRaQzKtZf35Cfpos5HR3Ly,https://www.instagram.com/p/B27-kQ_ncwf/
coll039,Make a Run for It,,,"Domesticated chickens could not escape when meant for sacrifice at pagan rituals such as during rice harvesting. Pigafetta didn’t know about it. But he learned chicken was eaten. At noon on Friday, March 22, 1521 native men brought coconut, sweet native oranges, a jar of palm wine and a cock that the expeditionary crew bought. They may have purchased a wild jungle fowl (Gallus bankiva) some historians think. Pigafetta recorded the local word for “galina” to be monoch. It is spelled manok in the languages of Bicol, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Maranaw, Pangasinan, Cebuano, Samar-Leyte, Tagalog; manuk in Pampangan, Ivatan, Maguindanao; manu in Ibanag. In 1613, labuyo meant a wild mountain chicken in Tagalog. Filipinos have been eating chicken for millennia. Archaeologists of the Philippine National Museum found chicken bones at Butuan in Mindanao dating to the 11th and 12th centuries and at Cagayan of northern Luzon in Peñablanca that are 11,000 years old and Lallo, dated as 2,800 years old.",Labuyo; Chicken,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3A4_hkHzA0/

James Robertson’s translation of brodo into English is sauce. It is wrong and must be changed to BROTH, a thin liquid that could use water, coconut water, stock (from meat, poultry, fish, seafood, vegetables). In Italian today the word for gravy or sauce is fondo.

coll042,Poor Pigs,,,"Pigafetta and his crew-mates feasted on pork during their first Easter Sunday in Asia, still in central Philippine waters. That was on March 31, 1521. Easter is the major Christian feast. It celebrates how Jesus Christ died for the sake of his kind, people who believe in him and his church, allowing them life ever after. The native king sent Magallanes (Pigafetta’s boss) two swine for their meal. Thanks to archaeological work by the Philippine National Museum, we know pork was eaten by Filipino ancestors 7,000 years ago. It would have been hunted pig. The Ifugao of northern Philippines fault an overly curious Malimayu for interfering with a divine effort for zero hunger and that would have spared the lives of pigs and stopped hunting them forever. A piece of pork dripping with blood provided by a magical pig was suppose to give delicious meat always. That way only one wild pig would be sacrificed for the sake of its kind. But Malimayu was unfaithful to the instructions. She squeezed and wrung the pork till it had no more blood and died! So even today, pigs give their lives so people can live.",Easter Sunday; Asia; Pork,Magellan Menu,,,The Resurrection by Piero Della Francesca dated to 1463,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fsmSzJos_ULnb_NdDiE0yESAxTmjH3ht,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fsmSzJos_ULnb_NdDiE0yESAxTmjH3ht,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fsmSzJos_ULnb_NdDiE0yESAxTmjH3ht,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3OF53oHiXq/
coll043,Drunk on Nipa Sap,,,"Pigafetta is the first to record a Philippine word for wine. In 1521 he wrote that the Cebuano word for vino (wine) was TUBA NIO NIPA. Tuba wine was made from distilling the juice of nipa, the only palm growing in water. The sap flowed from a cut made in a flower stalk (where the globular fruit would grow) conveniently located near the ground. A bamboo pitcher was hung on a joint till it filled with about 2 litres of sap that would ferment into intoxicating wine. Everyone drank too much almost everyday and slept so well that work was put off by Spanish and natives alike. Nipa, pronounced with slight differences, is the local term for “Nipa fruticans” in Indonesia, Malaysia, Antique, Cebu, Leyte, Panay, Samar, Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, Pampanga, Pangasinan. In other parts of the Philippines it is called sasa or lasa. Into the 1920s nipa was considered a most important plant from an economic standpoint. It was not only still popular as an alcoholic drink but as vinegar. Nipa has feathery leaves stretching 7 meters high and sprouts from a root growing in soil under the waterline. The palm grew in dense clusters hard to penetrate and thus served as a defensive barrier when invaders rowed upstream. In Pangil Bay, Mindanao there was a 9,000 hectare area where nipa grew! North of Manila Bay, mangrove trees were replaced by nipa. Today, nipa forests need replanting. But are the rivers and streams healthy enough for them to survive?",Nipa; Tuba Nio Nipa; Tuba wine,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qohofAs3Fg-6GOkACOMS2SYP5PxzEOC0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qohofAs3Fg-6GOkACOMS2SYP5PxzEOC0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qohofAs3Fg-6GOkACOMS2SYP5PxzEOC0,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3SATE3HsDD/

While at Guam, the crew raided and torched a village whose men had stolen a small tender hanging from the flagship. Sick comrades begged that entrails of the newly killed Guamanians be fed to them! European civilisation during the Renaisssance still practised medical cannibalism, an ancient use of human body parts and fluids in curing. Romans drank the blood of slain gladiators hoping for vitality. They even suggested drinking blood form the arms of young people. In the 1500s, medical cannibalism is said to have reached its height.

The book gives the background behind slow-cooking family recipes and traces stomach links between grandmas, moms and pops and their cooking daughters and sons. A winner!'---Gilda Cordero-Fernando\n'This mouth-watering book makes us reflect on slow/fast food, and calls to mind an obscure quote from Jose Rizal. In the manner of a Zen koan, he said 'Hay mas dias que longanisas.' Based on the references to food and cooking in his novels and writings, it would probably be safe to presume that he would be an advocate of slow food and would relish this book as much as I have enjoyed it.' ---Ambeth R. Ocampo, Chair, National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Chair, National Historical Institute\n'Like slow love, slow food whets the appetite even as this is being fed. The symbiotic action can only ensure a continuum of layered, crossover demand and appreciation. It also provides a fine counterpoint to the fast-track quality of lives often spent on quick, wham-bam indulgences. Hours spent on loving ministry over a fire or any other heating element can only ensure full satisfaction. That is also how we many indulge in this book, a little at a time, appreciating the continuing flame of its traditional passion, Pinoy-style- in customary tingi, a nibble here, a nibble there, while already smacking our lips at the prospect of further dalliances.
