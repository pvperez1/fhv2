coll001,Food to Sail Around the World,,,"Five ships were selected to be the Armada de Maluco. Their destination was Maluco, also called the Spice Islands of today's Indonesia. Trinidad was the flagship with around 61 men to feed including Ferdinand Magellan, the fleet's chief. San Antonio the largest by tonnage had 57 men, the Concepcion where Sebastian Elcano was assigned had a crew of 44, the Victoria had 44, and the smallest ship the Santiago had 31. Daily rations were computed for 237 persons although the actual number sailing is uncertain because manifests are not identical. The food was to last two years. The fleet left on August 10, 1519. They should have food to last till August 9, 1521. Only the Victoria skippered by Elcano returned on September 6, 1522. Only 18 of the original voyagers survived.

coll003,Holy Week Abstinence,,,"The expedition to the Spice Islands with Magellan in command experienced Holy Weeks in 1520, 1521, and 1522. Conforming to the Catholic rituals was important to the crew. Their lives were constantly in peril, especially from storms and hunger. The first Palm Sunday was 8 months into their provisions to last 2 years. They had anchored at St. Julian port in Argentina where autumn was starting in the Southern Hemisphere. The geese and sea-wolves they hunted as fresh food were penguins and seals, respectively. In 1521, Palm Sunday was at Homonhon Island, Samar form where on Holy Monday they sailed south. By Good Friday, March 29 according to Pigafetta's reckoning, they were in Mazaua (Limasawa) of Southern Leyte. Their Easter Sunday was celebrated with a meal of two swine given by Datus Colambu and Siauri. The meal was cooked on board. The last Holy Week (with Elcano now skippering the Victoria) found them somewhere in the Indian Ocean where on April 16 they headed north to Africa. Modern calculations identify March 26, 1522 as Easter Sunday. There was no feasting. The men were suffering inanition and catabolysis: the effects of extreme starvation. Whatever provisions they had loaded in Tidore, the center for clove, had deteriorated or been consumed. Their Philippine Holy Week, with Magellan still alive, was the friendliest of their foreign Easters.","Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Antonio Pigafetta; Datu Colambu; Datu Siauri; Spice Islands; Argentina; Homonhon Island, Samar; Limasawa; Mazaua; Leyte; Tidore",Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative collectible for the Quincentennial,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM_ZNI7HlgC/
coll004,Too Little,,,"The Magellan expedition was one of discovery. It sought a maritime route from the Atlantic via South America into the Spice Islands. There was enough salted and dried food for two years that constantly needed replenishment of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, potable water, and firewood. Sailors recognised hunger, scurvy, and beriberi as enemies just like storms and shipwreck. Magellan sensing a long journey, decreased daily rations as allowed legally. In December 1519, four months into the provisions some men grumbled and asked to increase their food. Magellan appealed to their loyalty to the Crown and appeased them. He reminded that they had been finding abundant fresh food since they had left Spain. But the next year on the night of Palm Sunday April 1 , 1520 some officers mutinied! They seized three of the boats, then ransacked and distributed food to the crew hoping to win their loyalty for a trip back to Spain. They were 8 months into the journey. Two leaders were executed and two other instigators exiled to Patagonia. Forty of the crew were not executed because they were needed to sail the ships. One ship got wrecked and it seems its provisions went down with the boat although the crew survived. They transferred to the remaining four boats that stretched their food to accommodate them. By August 1520 the armada had reached the midway point of their stored provisions. In November of 1520, Magellan discovered the passage that led to the unknown Pacific Ocean. The San Antonio deserted and returned to Spain. Magellan should have had 8 months of food left when the remaining 3 ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on November 28, 1520. But they did not expect the vastness of the Pacific they were discovering for Europe. They survived by eating rats, the main yard cover made of ox hide, and sawdust from the ship's boards. They were unable to fish in the deep waters. The provisions had spoiled and ran out during the 3 months and 20 days it took them to reach Guam.",Ferdinand Magellan; Armada de Maluco; Guam; Spain; Spice Islands; Patagonia; mutiny,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Magellan coin.,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNB4DMRHEYp/
coll005,Out of Food,,,"Calculating exactly how many men arrived on three ships at Homonhon Island in 1521 is complicated. There could have been roughly 130 men for Magellan to find new water and food for. The peaceful strategies were firstly, to fish, hunt and forage at uninhabited islands or places where islanders allowed them to. The swine eaten at Homonhon Island may have been hunted there. No mention is made if they were carried from Guam. A second means is to receive food as gifts. The 9 men from Samar’s Suluan Island, the first of ancestral Filipinos to encounter the Spanish Armada, gave fish, 2 coconuts, assorted banana, and a jar of native wine from their supplies. One suspects the Europeans could not have fattened up in the 10 days from the time they secured food in Guam to the time they met the Suluans. The natives could have recognised the look of sailors who had suffered extreme hunger. The third means is to barter for food. The Suluans returned after 4 days with rice, chicken and other foodstuff which were paid for with beads, caps, textiles, clothing and other goods. But the ships carried only a finite amount of trade items and they were needed to purchase spices in Maluco, their ultimate destination.",Suluan Island; Cruxificion,Magellan Menu,,,CRUCIFIXION by Juan Flandes. 1519.

coll006,When Negotiations Failed,,,"When peaceful means failed to secure provisions, many sailors turned aggressive. Ships and villages were raided for supplies. Hostages were ransomed for food. In Cebu, Magellan required a food quota for chiefs loyal to Rajah Humabon. Humabon, the Captain’s blood brother, had pledged allegiance to the Spanish King. He was expected to assist the royal armada. When one village refused to give its quota, Magellan burned it. Such terrorist tactics were an underlying cause for the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu spurned the order. He fought to protect his people and their right to food security. Political competition among local chiefs was likely not his sole motive. Antonio Pigafetta was from the Republic of Venice, a rival in the spice trade. The passenger manifesto does not name him. It lists an Antonio Lombardo, Lombardy being within Spain’s Italian realm. He was among those added legally beyond the passenger cut off. A papal ambassador likely helped Pigafetta get on board for the adventure of a lifetime.",Rajah Humabon; Magellan; Basilica of Santi Nazaro e Celso; Lombardy; Antonio Pigafetta;,Magellan Menu,,,"The AVEROLDI POLYPTYCH.

coll007,Restocking,,,"Renaissance food preservation for naval voyages was limited to mostly dried, salted and dried, or brined foods.  Replenishing fresh supplies including water was mandatory for survival. Fresh foods the circumnavigation crew found in the Philippines included some familiar to them like pigs and chickens.  The domesticated varieties were usually prestige foods used in pagan rituals for thanksgiving and when requesting bountiful food, safe childbirth, and healing.  The crew of mixed European ethnicities also found familiar fish, crab, goat, citruses, bananas, honey, salt, ginger, garlic, rice, millet, panicum and sorghum. Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique would have known the foods of Insular Southeast Asia. Pigafetta from Vicenza seems to have tried coconut for the first time. He wrote of its uses as wine, vinegar, oil, water, milk and a substitute for bread. Although rice was cooked in a clay pot above fire as in Spain, rice was also cooked in a bamboo tube placed under fire.  He found cakes wrapped in leaves, some of rice and others of millet.  One rice cake was called tinapay, according to him. Other foods he and his mates may have found unusual were bat meat, turtle eggs and tabon eggs. He heard about a delicacy called Laghan Snails found attached to the hearts of dead whales. Like explorers over the millennia and even today, the Armada’s crew had to eat whatever would keep them alive.",Philippines; Antonio Pigafetta; Laghan Snails,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Coin,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNRMIH1nxAR/
coll008,Pig and Peacock,,,"The special meal for visitors in Cebu as in much of Insular Southeast Asia was an all-meat menu. Pigafetta and comrades ate 35 different meats including peacock during a welcome meal sent to them by the Bornean Sultan.  For their audience with him, they were fetched by elephants. One wonders what was served at the farewell meal hosted by Humabon in Cebu after Magellan’s death.  He invited the crew and said he would give them the gold jewelry they knew he had had crafted for the Spanish King.  The new Armada leader wanted to secure from Humabon guides who knew the route to the Moluccas. The meal turned out to be a trap and almost everyone who went was massacred. Pigafetta had been wounded in the face by an arrow and was swollen, so could not go.  The three ships left immediately. One wonders if the Armada would have gotten to the Spiceries quicker than they had if Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique were with them. Magellan had likely reached Mindanao from Portuguese territories when he was still a soldier-sailor for the country of his birth. No one knows with certainty what was Enrique’s fate. Wanting freedom, did he plan the massacre with Humabon? Others suggest he was killed because he wore Spanish garments and would have been mistaken for one. Was Lapulapu in with the plot? No one knows for sure.

coll009,Nearby Brunei,,,"The Armada de Maluco, having escaped from Cebu, scuttled one ship in Bohol because there were not enough men left to sail her. Magellan died in April so did not experience the crew’s first stop at a Muslim settlement. It was on July 9 that several  canoes accompanying a beautiful prau with 8 elderly chiefs and musicians in it approached them. The prau decorated in gold flew from its bow blue and white banners topped by peacock feathers. Each of the two Spanish ships was presented with a wooden jar covered in yellow silk and filled with betelnut chew and orange blossoms.  Two cages with fowl, several goats, bundles of sugarcane, and three jars of distilled rice wine as clear as water were also given.  Six days later a spectacle of three praus with musicians playing drums and gongs came with foods made only of rice, some wrapped in leaves, some shaped like loaves, and others made like tarts with eggs and honey. The Armada gave presents to the 7 chiefs and herald in the group and sent through them gifts for the king, queen, and governor.

coll010,Courtly Food,,,"The Armada’s officials were allowed by Borneo’s Rajah Siripada to load water, fresh food and firewood. They presented gifts during an audience at court. When done they were served refreshments that included clove and cinnamon. The spices were known by Filipino ancestors but not noticed in their cuisine by Pigafetta. The Armada officials proceeded to the house of Siripada’s governor where they ate a full meal. Nine men arrived, each carrying a large wooden tray from the king. Each tray had 10-12 porcelain dishes filled with veal, capon, chicken, peacock, fish and other animal meat. All in all there were 30-32 different kinds of meat in addition to fish. Rice and sweet foods were included along with gold spoons like those in Europe for the guests’ use. Distilled wine was drank in porcelain cups the size of an egg. Pigafetta recorded nothing as elaborate at any of the courts in Philippine waters. ctto Vintage postal image of a peacock.

coll011,Life-Saving Clove,,,"On July 29, 1521 the Armada’s 2 ships escaped from Borneo! They feared being trapped and captured several Bornean trading junks. On one was Siripada’s captain-general feared throughout the region. He was the “son of the King of Luzon” and got away with the junks by bribing with gold the Armada’s new commander Johan Carvalho who was replaced subsequently. The prince would have been Muslim. The only Muslim community spotted by the Armada in Philippine waters was at Cagayan Island: a small population banished from Borneo. The Bornean experience served them well when they finally reached the Moluccas. On November 8, 1521 they entered the harbor of one Spice Island, Tidore. Its ruler Rajah Sultan Manzor became their patron. He filled the ships with clove, provided guides who knew the Laut Chidol (South Sea), and helped provision the Armada for its trip back to Spain.

coll012,Insular Asian Foods,,,"Pigafetta and the men of the Armada expanded their tastes of Insular Southeast Asian foods while loading clove at Tidore Island. Its leader Rajah-Sultan Manzor became their patron. Pigafetta learned of labu (possibly a wild cucumber), calama (rhubarb), itich (gander), ansa (goose). At Buru (the third largest island of the Moluccas) he recorded chanali (a delicacy of banana, Javanese almond and honey wrapped in leaves). Back in Tidore, Pigafetta discovered “wooden bread”. It was the sole (or principal) provision of island sailors he explained. He described it as made of “soft wood,” actually the pith of a palm covered in thorns. The soft wood was also known as saghu. There is no mention if wooden bread would be carried on the journey to Spain. There was no sea biscuit, the hard and double baked wheat bread that European mariners depended on. Their expedition had been teaching them about Asian food, psyche, and social relations. ctto Commemorative Lapulapu medal minted by the Philippine Central Bank.",Antonio Pigafetta; Rajah-Sultan Manzor; Tidore Island,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Lapulapu medal minted by the Philippine Central Bank.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN1YKphHtS4/
coll013,Extreme Hunger Notwithstanding,,,"In preparation for the trip to Seville, the 2 ships stocked bamboo tubes taller than a person filled with drinking water. They may have had goats, but certainly no pork since they were in an Islamic sultanate. Maybe they carried unripe bananas, coconuts, rice, sagho, dried fish. Only the Victoria would continue on. The Trinidad, suddenly leaking badly, would attempt to retrace the Pacific and South American route after making repairs. Meanwhile, the winds were favourable to sail west. On February 11, 1522 Victoria left Timor, the last island with fresh supplies. As they crossed from the South Sea to Africa, as Pigafetta wrote: because they had no salt their food putrified. If Portuguese spotted them, their clove and maps would be confiscated. They would all be taken prisoners. After 9 weeks rounding the Cape of Good Hope in tempestuous seas they reached the Atlantic Ocean. They had broken a mast and were leaking. Being in waters where it was legal for them, they stopped at a Portuguese port on Cape Verde Islands for food feigning they had been exploring Spanish America and were heading home. The ruse worked but not for long. Leaving 13 of their men still ashore, Elcano and all who had remained aboard sailed off to avoid the Portuguese sure to give chase. When the Victoria reached Spain on September 6, 1522 only 18 of the 237 original crew who began the trip on August 10, 1519 were alive. Of the 13 natives from Tidore who helped navigate only 4 made it. Sebastian Elcano, a Basque native, had brought the Victoria home. They had completed the first circumnavigation against all odds: an unknown route, bad weather, mutiny, warring natives, fear of the unknown, sickness, and prolonged hunger. Humanity was victorious. ctto Commemorative coin featuring the Victoria.",Victoria; Trinidad; Antonio Pigafetta; Sebastian Elcano,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative coin featuring the Victoria.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN3lbT1HfBf/

coll015,When Bread Meant Rice Cake,,,"Tinapay, today’s Filipino word for wheat bread, originally meant “a certain kind of rice cake.” We owe that fact to Pigafetta who in 1521 listed words in the Cebuano area and their meanings. He did not describe tinapay so no one knows what it really was. Did he not encounter other rice cakes, what we call kakanin now? Missionaries of the later 1500s used tinapay as the word for host when explaining it to new native converts. In the 1800s, tinapay was described by the Recollect priest Juan Felix De Encarnación as a flour circle with a sweet filling that was folded in half to resemble the moon. Perhaps because it resembled the circular host, tinapay was selected by pioneering missionaries. They also used tinapay for wheat bread when referring to miracles of Jesus Christ such as feeding a multitude with just a few fish and bread loaves. Filipinos did not know wheat or wheat bread at the time. They were brought by the Spanish. Later “hostia” was introduced as the word for host; tinapay stayed as generic for wheat bread. Many words around the world change meanings in small and big ways.",Bread; Pan,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3YIpd2nAJm/
coll016,Where did Pigafetta Discover Millet in the Philippines?,,,"In 1521 Pigafetta recorded that miglio (millet in Italian) was called HUMAS at the Visayan island of Mazaua where food included citrus, rice, coconut, and more. While Limasawa in southern Leyte is considered to be Mazaua, a case has been made that it might actually have been Masao, in the Caraga area of Mindanao! Historians are debating the evidence again. Millet was likely the fall-back cereal during drought when rice would not grow. Today humas is better known as KABOG, actually the word for fruit bat. It seems fruit bats eat millet and in northern Cebu’s town of Catmon, rice cake of millet is called BUDBUD KABOG. There is even an annual budbud kabog festival every February 10.

He had distinguished himself in the Portuguese military and maritime service, even reaching Malacca under Alfonso d’Albuquerque who sought to expand the Portuguese empire. Magallanes was no stranger to Asia when he got to the Philippines in 1521. He would have known bananas, coconuts, and other foods that a European crew could live on when food loaded in Spain ran out.

Roasting is an early, basic cooking technique. One only needs an open fire to roast. RP archaeological sites in Tawi Tawi and Butuan, areas within the scope of Pigafetta’s voyage had remains of cooked food, likely roasted, as far back as 7,000 years ago and the 11th and 12th centuries of the Common Era, respectively.

Pigafetta recorded that at the time there was not only roasting but, in earthenware pots, cooking. Perhaps the broths with fish or pork were made in them. But he also recorded cooking in bamboo tubes. Broths can be cooked in them as well in shells. Pigafetta preferred the rice cooked in bamboo to that cooked in a pot. He wrote that leaves were used as a pot liner when rice was cooked. In Cebu tagnáwan tree leaves were known in the 19th century to serve the purpose. One wonders if they may have been used because Pigafetta knew banana leaves but did not say they lined pots. In the Philippines the earliest earthenware so far found by the Philippine National Museum is 7,340 years old and from Tawi-Tawi.

coll028,Pigafetta’s Elephant Ride,,,"In addition to roasting and cooking in a clay pot, Pigafetta identified a third cooking procedure practised in 1521: baking. It is first mentioned as the way cakes of rice and millet wrapped in leaves were made. The cakes were part of the ritual to consecrate a pig for sacrifice. Likely the thickly wrapped cakes were baked inside mounds of hot ash, even the remains of fires used for roasting. (The beehive oven was introduced much later.) While sailing in southern waters he arrived at Borneo. On June 15, 1521 three praus from there brought foods including rice wrapped in leaves. Some resembled sugar loaves in size and shape; others were somewhat longish. There was also rice made in the manner of tarts using egg and honey. He was fetched later by 2 elephants with silk trappings to bring him to and from the Borneo king. The elephants were preceded by a dozen men carrying porcelain jars covered with silk and containing the crew’s gifts. Borneo is really close geographically to the Philippines. One wonders if it is true that the Sultan of Sulu had elephants, their 2 progenitors a gift from the ruler of Java that is also nearby. Dwarf elephants lived on Luzon 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago.

It is only when he gets to Borneo that he mentions being served refreshments of cloves and cinnamon. He finds the best cinnamon growing, though, on “the island of Butuan and Calaghan” and after leaving Visayan islands for good, finds cloves in 5 islands making up the Moluccas. But residents of the Visayas knew the spices the Portuguese bought. In Cebuano, Pigafetta records MANISSA for pepper, CHIANCHE for clove, MANA for cinnamon.

coll030,A Taste of Visayan Food,,,"The first circumnavigation crew would have satisfied their tastebud cravings the way Visayans did. One of Pigafetta’s most important observations is that the natives knew natural fermentation: coconut vinegar and alcoholic beverages of coconut, nipa, and rice. Before fermentation, tuba was sweetish. Along with honey, ripe fruits, and fresh sugarcane juice one’s sweet tooth could be satisfied. Tastebuds are warning devices of the human body, alerting when there is not enough or a surfeit of a taste that could cause sickness, even emotional imbalance. Sourness came from the coconut vinegar and native lemon. Salty was satisfied by salt. In fact Pigafetta found some dishes too salty. What could have been bitter? Charred meat as well as cinnamon and clove if they chewed on them. Maybe foraged fruits and leaves? Umami desire was satisfied by savory, “proteiny” cooked meats and meaty broths. No tastebud has been found reacting only and specifically to piquancy, so it is considered a mouth feel. Raw garlic and ginger provided the pricking to perk up a meal. Even if Pigafetta likely left out describing other culinary experiences, what he did describe celebrates how Filipinos used their surroundings to satisfy tastebuds, hunger and the dream of a good meal.

Other foods specified by Pigafetta are almonds, sweet and tasty pomegranates, watermelons, wild cucumbers, gourds, and comulicai similar to a large cucumber. He made a vocabulary of ""words spoken by Moro people in the area"" (also called ""A Malay Vocabulary"") noting they had only been there for the last 50 years having pushed the indigenous peoples upland to where the clove trees grow wild. In central Philippines he listed as food ""roots like turnips"" but he had no word for them. In the vocabulary he calls them ubi.

Certain filaments in the husk make a cord with which to bind native boats. Under the husk is a hard shell thicker than a walnut's that is burned and made into a useful powder. [Medicinal] Under that shell is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness eaten fresh with meat and fish as if it were bread. It tasted like almond to him; he explained it could be dried and eaten, too. In the middle of the marrowy substance is a clear, sweet, refreshing water. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. He described making a butter-like oil by boiling coconut marrow and water that had putrefied (fermented). When they wish to make vinegar, they let pure coconut water ferment under the sun. He learned to make coconut milk by scraping the marrow, mixing it with its own water, then straining it through cloth. He was told one tree could live to be a hundred years old.

One ate coconut meat chunks or rice cooked as solid as bread. Rice was the desired cereal, a food eaten in Spain and Italy because Moors from the Near East had cultivated it when they ruled Spain. Everywhere there was swine, goat, poultry, fish. One had to carry them live and slaughter as needed. The crew did not have salt to preserve the cuts while they sailed, he wrote. All around the region were coconut, banana, possibly also sugarcane. Praus bartered firewood needed for cooking on board. Water could be bought in long bamboo tubes that needed to be stored upright. One needed attractive fabrics, hats, clothing, glass beads, and metal to exchange for food. Otherwise one used kidnapping for ransom, storming small villages, and capturing laden boats to secure food.

It was believed the banana caused humankind’s damnation (not the apple) and that Adam dressed in its leaves giving it another term, CALZONES or BRAGAS DE ADÁN, Adam’s underpants. It is claimed Spanish knew the banana before the 1492 voyage of Columbus. Arabs may have brought the banana from its cradle of origin, the Eastern Indies to Europe.

coll037,Pigafetta Postlude,,,"Pigafetta's published eyewitness story about the first voyage around the world provides Philippine food writers with a baseline for ingredients and cooking procedures. His snippets also noted there was no great emperor lording over insular Southeast Asia; island kings fought each other even after intermarriage among their families; trade was an important factor for peace and political power; food was traded and given as gifts; feasting together could be a sign of friendship or a means to poison or hack away at guests. There was no campaign to make pagans Muslim. In Tidore, the crew killed all swine on board they had been keeping for food to please the Muslim King, their partner for securing clove and some nutmeg in the Moluccas. He gave them goats and poultry in exchange. It was known in the area and respected that Muslims did not like the looks and smells of pork. The provisions from Asia ran out. All the men on the carrack ""Victoria"" were starving as they reached Africa, but they refused to stop at Portuguese centres for food lest they be captured. The 18 who made it back to Sanlucar and Seville were emaciated. Their captain, Juan Sebastian Elcano (1476-1526), was rewarded by the king with gold ducats and a personal crest bearing the singular motto: Primus circumdedisti me.

So coconut vinegar is the earliest Philippine vinegar according to historical evidence.

They may have purchased a wild jungle fowl (Gallus bankiva) some historians think. Pigafetta recorded the local word for “galina” to be monoch. It is spelled manok in the languages of Bicol, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Maranaw, Pangasinan, Cebuano, Samar-Leyte, Tagalog; manuk in Pampangan, Ivatan, Maguindanao; manu in Ibanag. In 1613, labuyo meant a wild mountain chicken in Tagalog. Filipinos have been eating chicken for millennia. Archaeologists of the Philippine National Museum found chicken bones at Butuan in Mindanao dating to the 11th and 12th centuries and at Cagayan of northern Luzon in Peñablanca that are 11,000 years old and Lallo, dated as 2,800 years old.",Labuyo; Chicken,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3A4_hkHzA0/

Easter is the major Christian feast. It celebrates how Jesus Christ died for the sake of his kind, people who believe in him and his church, allowing them life ever after. The native king sent Magallanes (Pigafetta’s boss) two swine for their meal. Thanks to archaeological work by the Philippine National Museum, we know pork was eaten by Filipino ancestors 7,000 years ago. It would have been hunted pig. The Ifugao of northern Philippines fault an overly curious Malimayu for interfering with a divine effort for zero hunger and that would have spared the lives of pigs and stopped hunting them forever. A piece of pork dripping with blood provided by a magical pig was suppose to give delicious meat always. That way only one wild pig would be sacrificed for the sake of its kind. But Malimayu was unfaithful to the instructions. She squeezed and wrung the pork till it had no more blood and died!

coll043,Drunk on Nipa Sap,,,"Pigafetta is the first to record a Philippine word for wine. In 1521 he wrote that the Cebuano word for vino (wine) was TUBA NIO NIPA. Tuba wine was made from distilling the juice of nipa, the only palm growing in water. The sap flowed from a cut made in a flower stalk (where the globular fruit would grow) conveniently located near the ground. A bamboo pitcher was hung on a joint till it filled with about 2 litres of sap that would ferment into intoxicating wine. Everyone drank too much almost everyday and slept so well that work was put off by Spanish and natives alike. Nipa, pronounced with slight differences, is the local term for “Nipa fruticans” in Indonesia, Malaysia, Antique, Cebu, Leyte, Panay, Samar, Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, Pampanga, Pangasinan. In other parts of the Philippines it is called sasa or lasa. Into the 1920s nipa was considered a most important plant from an economic standpoint. It was not only still popular as an alcoholic drink but as vinegar. Nipa has feathery leaves stretching 7 meters high and sprouts from a root growing in soil under the waterline. The palm grew in dense clusters hard to penetrate and thus served as a defensive barrier when invaders rowed upstream. In Pangil Bay, Mindanao there was a 9,000 hectare area where nipa grew! North of Manila Bay, mangrove trees were replaced by nipa. Today, nipa forests need replanting.

It also provides a fine counterpoint to the fast-track quality of lives often spent on quick, wham-bam indulgences. Hours spent on loving ministry over a fire or any other heating element can only ensure full satisfaction. That is also how we many indulge in this book, a little at a time, appreciating the continuing flame of its traditional passion, Pinoy-style- in customary tingi, a nibble here, a nibble there, while already smacking our lips at the prospect of further dalliances.

Sardinella fimbriata, the round-bodied sardine, was called Lao-Lao or Tamban Lao-Lao commonly. It was a marine species that entered river mouths and was abundant in central and southern Philippines. It also lived in waters of East India, the East Indies and China. In 1890, Jose Rizal published from Paris an annotated version of Morga’s book. He ventured that LAULAU may have been TAWILIS. Today we know tawilis is the world’s only freshwater sardine and is found in Taal Lake, the current name of Bonbon Lake. The Lake was linked to Balayan Bay by Pansipit River, an actively navigated channel. An eruption in 1754, however, silted up the mouth and a narrower river eventually formed nearby.

One wonders why in the Philippines it also is called sampaloc. In 1567 tamarind saplings were entrusted from Cebu to a ship captain for the Spanish King. They were to be planted in Mexico to provide a nearer source for the commercially profitable ingredient than Asia. By 1573 they were fruiting and suggest that Mexico’s first tamarinds came from Filipinas.

By 1595-1603 while he was there, very few of the original conquerors who had arrived with Miguel Lopez de LEGASPI in 1565 to begin settling for Spain, were still alive. He documents chickens being eaten by natives and settlers. Food was always a challenge. What his book doesn’t include are documents from the Audencia where he worked requiring in 1598 that the city contract 19 riflemen-hunters to provide at least 1 buffalo for sale daily at the public slaughterhouse. Neither does he reveal that Chinese and Filipinos were required to raise chicken and swine under penalty of fine. The animals would form part of the settlers diet. Specified nearby towns were required to bring to Intramuros weekly 300 laying hens, a number of swine considered proper, as well as 2,000 eggs. The foods were not reimbursed by currency or barter goods. They were contributed in theory for the protection and organised governance the foreigners were providing. How were the eggs cooked?

One guarded the wine supply. Morga wrote that Filipinos made a local wine. “They drink that which drips out of the tender flowers of coconut trees and of nipa palms which are abundant and raised like vineyard-grapes although with less care and difficulty.” The juice was then distilled until fermented strong or light in intensity. He classified tuba as a clear fluid like water but strong and dry. It is interesting that he noted: “When used moderately, it is medicinal for the stomach and good for phlegms and other kinds of rhems. When mixed with Spanish wine, it becomes a pleasant liquor which is tasteful and wholesome.” Perhaps today’s competitive bar masters can develop a tuba and wine cocktail celebrating culinary mixing?",Wine; Tuba,Antonio Morga 30,,,"A Young Man Drinking (in the style of Spanish Baroque painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, 1617-1682) National Gallery, UK",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L3YMA9ZYP2nJaLpswChavCWeIeZnc-0v,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L3YMA9ZYP2nJaLpswChavCWeIeZnc-0v,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L3YMA9ZYP2nJaLpswChavCWeIeZnc-0v,https://www.instagram.com/p/B5j-9Y7nbbm/

When brined it is an aperitif and on a difficult galleon voyage offered comfort from sea-sickness and perked up poor appetites. In Filipinas olive trees refused to grow during Morga’s time. He wrote that in lieu of olive there was “a green, very small fruit, more diminutive than a nut, called PAOS.” He added: “when properly prepared for eating [pao] has a good taste when served as pickles or brined.” The fruit is 5-8 centimetres long and 4-6 centimetres wide. Pao or paho (Mangifera altissima) was common and distributed in forests from northern Luzon to southern Mindanao. As of 1921 paho was not cultivated. Neither was there ever a business in bottling or canning paho pickles or paho in brine. Perhaps those are reasons paho has become rare.

No one is sure how safflower got to Manila where is was also used to color textile. Safflower flowers were cultivated by Filipinos to sell as a substitute for costly saffron that did not grow locally. Saffron turned fish escabeche and rice dishes a lovely golden hue. Morga is silent about safflower’s culinary uses. He only writes that from 1595 to 1603 the food coloring was grown.

coll081,Husking,,,"Morga wrote that around when Manila City turned 25 years old, native women pounded rice to be cooked by them as part of daily meals that included boiled fish. Women raised pigs and chickens while men did more physically demanding work in fields or while fishing. They kept house for “husbands and parents” and did excellent needlework, spun cotton, wove blankets. Women were the home cooks. Important is the implied status of women described by Morga: When both men and women go to church or take a walk along the streets, they walk with slow dignified steps accompanied by male and female slaves who always carry parasols to protect them from rain and sun. The ladies walk ahead followed by their female servants and slaves, then their husbands, fathers and brothers follow with their male servants and slaves. He also noted that there was high literacy, with natives writing using what we call today baybayin. It is an indigenous script that was used as early as 300 CE. Examples are at the Philippine National Museum of Anthropology.

coll082,Fusions,,,"In the first 30 years of Filipinas as a Spanish colony, Morga described that colonials, natives, seasonal foreign traders, Chinese workers, and Japanese Christian religious refugees lived apart from each other. The Chinese quarter with its market, food sellers, and artisans is where exposure to Chinese ingredients and cooked food may have taken place. Intramuros had 600 houses where only Spanish could live; another 600 were outside the walls. Fort Santiago had only 30 soldiers and officers; 8 artillery men guarded the Walled City’s gates. There were at least 150 priests of the different orders living at Intramuros. Most Hispanics lived there with the only other places allowed being Cebu, Villa de Arevalo (Iloilo area), Nueva Segovia (Cagayan), Nueva Caceres (Camarines). There were few Spanish settlers and only a few years before Morga arrived was the colony given a budget for 400 pay-soldiers. Natives revolted and the colony was attacked by Chinese pirates and Borneans wanting to retake their trade route. Filipino food had not yet acquired Spanish influences due to few colonials and opportunities to experience their cuisine. New fruits, vegetables, and beef had been introduced as earlier vignettes in #antoniomorga30 noted, but they may not have been widespread yet.

Morga blundered the first maritime battle with the Dutch in 1600 that lost 137 of 200 men on his flagship. His valet removed his armour and they survived by clinging to a floating mattress. The number of resident colonials were far less than needed and those who stayed needed to be in fortified villages. Wives and children came with some of the career officials. How they coped is not recorded. But food was a challenge and it was natives and Chinese overseas workers who provided for the colonials. In 1603, when Morga was to take on a post in Mexico, the Chinese rebelled against unjust measures, burned half of Intramuros, and killed many residents prompting the largest exodus of Spanish who carried out a great amount of personal wealth.

coll085,A Nose For Food,,,"Around this time, March, Chinese traders who had arrived in Manila from December to early January would sail home happy with silver payment. Bobadilla writes, “Those Chinese merchants are so keen after gain that if one sort of merchandise has succeeded well one year, they take a great deal of it the following year.” So every Christmas season the Spanish were brought small oranges, nuts, chestnuts, raisins, plums, flour and more. A Spaniard lost his nose through a certain illness. He likely couldn’t smell his food anymore. He sent for a Chinese to make him one of wood to hide his deformity. It was so well done that the trader was well rewarded. The next year he brought a fine boatload of wooden noses. But in order to sell, writes Bobadilla, “he would have to cut off the noses of all the Spaniards in the colony.” Figuring out what new products the export market desires is a recurring dilemma even today. In a twist of events, the noses of Catholic statuary were chopped off during the Philippine Revolution that started in 1896 because they looked Spanish.",Chinese; Trading,Diego Bob 1616,,,"“Head of a Man,” Diego Velazquez, c. 1616 the year Bobadilla arrived in Manila.

coll086,Canon Fruit,,,"“Carne de membrillo,” flesh of quince fruit, is a favourite Spanish conserve from its Moorish past. It was carried by Magellan’s voyage of exploration. (See #magellanmenu) Quince couldn’t grow in tropical Philippines. Diego Bobadilla, SJ notes that starfruit, balimbing, birambi (Averrhoa carambola) could be conserved. It tasted like plum when conserved with honey (later sugars) and smelled like quince when ripe on the tree. “Birimbines” conserve was used on galleon trips back to Mexico. It was even ordered by residents there. Native to tropical Southeast Asia, possibly the Moluccas in particular, it spread to the South Pacific and East Asia, although when remains to be traced. ”Carambola” in Spanish means a canon, the sound of a canon, billiards and the sound of billiard balls hitting each other. Was there a military projectile shaped like starfruit? How and why carambola was applied to a sourish fruit with a cross section resembling a star could remain a conundrum.",Quince; Ferdinand Magellan; Carambola,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Illustration by Kaarin Wall in her book A JAKARTA MARKET published for charities of the American Women’s Association, Jakarta, Indonesia 1983 and 1985.",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KODlmzqCdExgK358WChduYN6jEej1ObY,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KODlmzqCdExgK358WChduYN6jEej1ObY,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KODlmzqCdExgK358WChduYN6jEej1ObY,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-OuckLnFZF/
coll087,Malesian Santol,,,"Bobadilla, who arrived in the Philippines in 1616, singled out not only star fruit (See DB3) but santol (Sandoricum koetjape) as exotic fruits made into “conserva.” New varieties have been bred with thinned santol skin, thickened flesh to spoon out, and increased sweetness over natural tartness. It has enough pectin making it good for preserves and jams. The Philippines, Borneo, Malaysia and Sumatra fall into one of three subdistricts of the MALESIAN biogeographical region which is why they have botanicals in common, like santol. Missionaries not only provide early informal references to Philippine food but scientific data for the 16th through 19th centuries.

coll088,"Conserves, 1613",,,"Three years before Bobadilla arrived in Manila, several types of native conserves were documented. Perhaps he ate all three. Calamay was a mixture of honey and flour fried in coconut oil. One also could have buchayo (pronounced boo-kah-yoh ) made of coconut or sesame seed. The terms conserva, buchayo and turron were interchangeable then. Four centuries later, pili turron was included among Philippine creole recipes. Turron means nougat. Introduced to Spain, and possibly first made in Jijona, during Moorish times it combines almond, egg white and honey. Bukayo was a common sweet served at the end of a Philippine meal before fancier options dominated. Foods are like fashion. They rise, fall, and may resurrect in their original version or as contemporary innovation.

The oldest printed recipe for bukayo is dated 1911 and named Coconut Dulce.",Calamay; Buchayo; Turron,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Image from FSM Library: Bukayo recipe by Pura Villanueva Kalaw in Condimentos Indígenas, 1918.",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZpN-vS_QpfCp6em5jBdGlnKwZxkkbwX8,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZpN-vS_QpfCp6em5jBdGlnKwZxkkbwX8,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZpN-vS_QpfCp6em5jBdGlnKwZxkkbwX8,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Q8dQpH1ww/
coll089,"Sweeteners, 1609-1616",,,"In these bitter times, we all need some sweetness. So far we have enumerated since 1521 sugarcane chewed for its sweet juice, honeys and coconut syrup (miel de coco also called polot tuba). There are others for which there is written evidence. They were explained as the native “miel de caña,” sugarcane syrup the Spanish knew. But local versions were: polot panilan (honey from beehive); polot sasa (nipa); polot buli (buri). The latter two are palms like the coconut; the process of making honey from their sap is identical to that of polot tuba. Another important word in “sweet history” from the years being studied is BALÁS. In Pampangan, Cebuano and Tagalog it means crystallised syrup, granulated syrup. Syrups could have been from palms. The progression from syrup to solidified sugar and granules is easily imagined. In 1613 an active Tagalog word was PACASCAS. It was “curds like sugar sold in small baskets by Indios at the Parian [market] of Manila.” To a Spaniard “like sugar” probably meant like sugarcane granules. Pacascas is palm sugars. BAGKAT in Pampangan and Tagalog was likewise active: syrup cooked into a soft candy. When defining Philippine cuisine, precolonial sweeteners have an important role. Cooking with them today is one way of providing an antique, insular Southeast Asian, “native” flavour.",Honey; Syrups,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Pakaskas.

coll090,Sweet Salt,,,"During Bobadilla’s Philippine residence (1616-1648), he and other pioneering Spanish settlers could use honeys and native-made palm sugars. They probably rejoiced that Chinese traders annually brought what they hungered for: sugarcane sugar, once called “sweet salt” by Crusader-Knights who saw it for the first time. Sugarcane was known in ancient China but not till the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) was refining done. Around 727 Emperor Tai-Tsung sent a delegation to Magadha in India to learn how to turn sugarcane juice into much desired sugar crystals called “tang” in Chinese. From 766-779, a monk in Sichuan taught how to make rock sugar: boiling cane juice into a sticky liquid and letting it flow down a bamboo pipe into an urn where crystals formed. During the subsequent Sung Dynasty (960-1279) sugarcane became a top cash crop in Sichuan and the area from where Chinese workers in the Philippines came, Fukien. There were enough imported ingredients for Spanish to make some of their favourite homeland sweets: sugar, flour, olive oil, pork lard, almonds, raisins among others. But did they? Proof still needed. Natives outside Intramuros were still being converted to Catholicism, coaxed to live in a pueblo where a church would be built, and learn Spanish foods and customs.Two culinary systems for pleasing sweet desires were starting to meet. Priests and Chinese would bring in equipment from the New World and China to make sugarcane sugar during Bobadilla’s lifetime.",Palm sugar; Sugarcane,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). “Drawings of Plants from Moluccas,” c. 1805-1818. wikigallery.org",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uuCgEfi8Jpisgrrxs8Z5BL1LMO0qZs6a,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uuCgEfi8Jpisgrrxs8Z5BL1LMO0qZs6a,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uuCgEfi8Jpisgrrxs8Z5BL1LMO0qZs6a,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-YYAb1nqFy/
coll091,Cooking Camote 400 Years Ago,,,"Bobadilla in the early 1600s just like Pigafetta in 1521 records that rootcrops were eaten. He lists 4 cultivated ones. CAMOTE is a sweet potato, Ipomomea batatas. He writes it is the “potatoes of Spain” eaten by colonised and colonisers alike. There is APARI that a 19th-century source describes as white inside, nicely flavoured and called BARIBARAN in Borongan, Samar. UBI is an edible root characterised by a 1613 source as a hand-span or longer and white. A fourth kind was LAQUI. “Mountains furnish roots from which [natives] draw their most usual nourishment,” he added. One was PUGAIAN and the other COROT (Dioscorea triphylla or pentaphylla L.), a yam. Wild tubers were famine food, fallback when cultivated crops failed. Camote was often used as a generic term for all tubers, whatever their genus. How was camote cooked during Bobadilla’s time? He doesn’t say, however a few years before he arrived there is a document. LABON meant cooking a large quantity of tubers or meat. If it was a small amount of tubers it was as LAGA, in the juice or syrup of sugarcane (or likely plain water also). Cooking tubers in water was also called CQISA (gisa) but not referring to today’s stir-frying or complex stewing. Gisa then meant to cook rice, to make SAING that was done by cooking rice (or in this case, tuber) in water. Bobadilla has left insights into heritage cooking. Rootcrops remain healthy substitutes for emergencies and last long if stored properly.",Root crops; Camote; Sweet potato,Diego Bob 1616,,,Dioscorea alata. (Ube and ubi in the Philippines.)

coll092,Goat Horns,,,"Bobadilla noted that in common settings banana leaves on the ground [on the bamboo floor or over a mat, I suspect] marked where one should eat. Leaves were half a meter long and half that wide. Bananas recorded in the 1600s are saba, (healthy and good), bongolan (aromatic, green skinned), bangalan (aromatic, yellow, short), borohan (wild, lots of seeds, sweet), tanyanuang (very long) and sungay cambing (small, short, literally meaning horn of a goat). Some could be cooked in water. Banana originated in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. Arabs brought it westward from India. Varieties from the Americas (originally from Africa) would be introduced to the Philippines. Banana is a precolonial feature of Philippine cuisine to honour.",Bananas,Diego Bob 1616,,,Musa paradisiaca L. from plantgenera.org on pinterest.ph,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1do9dTR94cgKKKbpU63rlr8vxTsjmpDtd,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1do9dTR94cgKKKbpU63rlr8vxTsjmpDtd,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1do9dTR94cgKKKbpU63rlr8vxTsjmpDtd,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-YYAb1nqFy/
coll093,Banig Level,,,"Insular Southeast Asia is a floor-level culture. Spain introduced chair-level. Mat culture was so highly developed that there was a proper mat for each function. Some mats were specifically woven for heavy duty agricultural uses, others finer for everyday functions, and still others so artistically decorated with symbols and colours for ceremonies like those marking rites of passage. The banig is a precious element of Philippine culture to sustain. Bobadilla explained that while common eating was on banana leaves at ground level, the wealthy dined on low tables. They would have been sitting on mats as Pigafetta noted and the tables were low. Dulang is what Tagalogs call the low table that comes in many sizes. Several dulang can be placed end to end for large banquets. Important has been that one could eat with others.

coll094,Ship Loads,,,"Diego Bobadilla, SJ’s “Relation” covers 1616-1634. Natives used sailboats and CARACOA. The latter vessel had 3 layers of stations for rowers on each side. Manpower could reach 100 natives per boat. CARACOA were used as trading ships to carry dried fish, wine, salt, wax, cotton, coconut and other like merchandise in an active coastal trade. Spanish traded wax, storax, Ivory, bezoar in Borneo and Camboa. Two or three Portuguese ships from Macao brought silk, musk, precious stones and fragrant woods. Chinese traders noted in earlier posts brought persimmon and other fruit, parasols, porcelain, cloths the black ones used by Indians, paste gems, thread and the most esteemed whitest silk. Galleons larger than those in the Mediterranean were built at Manila where abaca was used for rigging. The galleon also transported missionaries. A subsidy was added for an outfit of clothing “they are won’t to wear,” a mattress, a blanket and straw for the voyage. Missionaries often lacked enough funds to cover meals while waiting for their galleons to leave Spain and Mexico. Part of their small royal subsidy ended up as handouts demanded at ports by petty bureaucrats. Burdens were heavy for Bobadilla and his brothers.",Sailboats; Caracoa; Ships; Trading,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Visayan Karakoa from Francisco Ignacio Alcina, 1668.

coll095,Bread & Wine,,,"Diego Bobadilla was made a Procurator. It meant he was to procure or draft Jesuits in Europe and bring them to Filipinas as missionaries. He explained fears that were real to the draftees: there was neither bread nor wine; the sea terrified; seasickness could keep them flat on their backs the entire trip; strange climate and illnesses could kill them. The Jesuit Pedro de Montes and his group of 20 Jesuits were assigned 3 ordinary cabins 10 feet long by 8 feet wide, and a fourth cabin slightly larger. A group of Jesuits traveling in 1625 had to lie with the feet of one resting on the head of another. Their cabin was a cubbyhole under the quarterdeck. They had to keep their ration of hard sea biscuit that attracted weevils beside them. Their door was so blocked with gear that they crawled into the cabin like cats. No one took off their clothes and soon vermin the size of chickpea attached to them, sucked their blood, and infested their food. At the stopover in Acapulco, bureaucrats refused to lodge them. They slept outdoors for 2 and a half months till they could make the Pacific crossing.

Then there was the Mexican layover of 5 months first at the convents in Mexico City and Puebla, then at Acapulco. It was then that they could taste Mexican cooking in the convents. The typical Pacific crossing was about 75 days. Perhaps because Bobadilla’s family was well known in Madrid and had royal connections, his group was assigned to the smaller of two galleons crossing the Pacific. The priests had a luggage room and the entire quarterdeck to themselves; Bobadilla even had his own room. The captain gave half of his accommodations at the poop deck in addition. They set up an infirmary on the portside for many who fell sick. They even fashioned a refectory on the poop deck using the passageway as a kitchen. Their comfortable quarters allowed them to follow their usual routine, offer religious instruction and service passengers.",Diego Bobadilla; Jesuits; Voyages and travels,Diego Bob 1616,,,"St. Peter Faber (1506-1546), co-founder, Society of Jesus. anastpaul.com",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j9LChT06YFnHzvSDOFqD-pwGEyDW46XX,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j9LChT06YFnHzvSDOFqD-pwGEyDW46XX,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j9LChT06YFnHzvSDOFqD-pwGEyDW46XX,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qsXQ5nANh/
coll097,Culinary Adjustments,,,"When Bobadilla and his 41 recruits arrived from Acapulco in 1643 they had to go overland to Manila from Lampon (Quezon Province) where the boat landed. 100 porters arrived with Fr. Ignacio Mujica to meet them. With 8 litters for the sick, they walked up and down slippery rain-washed trails through the Sierra Madre till they reached Bai Lake. At one descent, 11,000 steps were cut into the path. At Pangil village on the lakeshore, a lay brother awaited them with a “hot meal of enormous proportion,” Horacio de la Costa, SJ recounts in the history of his order published by Harvard University Press in 1961. The alcalde mayor provided boats that sailed them from the lake down Pasig River to the Walled City where bells pealed in welcome. Recruits adjusted to their new island home and its customs. They learned not to fear the foreign. There was local bread made from Japanese flour at the capital. At their assigned rural stations they ate rice like those they sought to make fine Christians: using their fingers. In the first 100 years of mission work, fervent piety ignited men like Bobadilla. This is the last of culinary vignettes based on his documents. We tend to judge historical events forgetting that attitudes change from one era to another. How well did an era display the best of humanity? Did the Jesuits and missionaries of other orders exemplify a new ideal model for natives to desire for themselves? Did the new Christian food customs make sense to Filipinos?

coll098,(no title),,,"In 1244, hermits at Tuscany sought unity under a common rule and officer. Pope Innocent IV gave them the Rule of Saint Augustine, one of the Fathers of the Church. The Augustinians were the first missionaries in the Philippines, having accompanied Miguel LOPEZ de LEGASPI in 1565 to start Spanish settlement. This fifth in a series of vignettes about Philippine cuisine is based on the HISTORIA written by the Augustinian missionary Juan de Medina in 1630. He, like Diego Bobadilla SJ of our previous vignettes, was in the colony as it was midway through the first century of Spanish rule.

Medina doesn’t write that lechon was served, but it may have been because today was the major fiesta for Cebu then. The Spanish flag was unfurled with the “greatest pomp possible.” The image of the Santo Niño at the Augustinian Convent “was carried in procession to the cathedral, after a piece of paper [had] been signed, by decree of justice, that it will be given back to the same religious.” There is a procession, mass, an Augustinian preaches, the image is returned. In the afternoon there is a bullfight “as extensive as their means allow — but that ... is slight.” After 50 years the city of Cebu, at the time named Santísimo Nombre de Dios, had “greatly declined.” There was a population loss with Spanish preferring to reside in Manila.

Perhaps the salty, banana-leaf-wrapped QUESEO still made in mountain towns of Cebu City descends from Fr. Juan Medina’s era. Before his time, around the 25th year of colonisation the King underwrote the import of 25 cows and 2 bulls from Mexico to begin Philippine breeding farms, first near Manila. The Augustinians had 2,000 head in Cebu but by Medina’s time, they were only 500. Indians came to like eating beef that they had disliked at first. Wild dogs disturbed calves. Cattle were introduced from Spain to Mexico where they had been unknown. After 1540 the cattle brought from Mexico to Peru spread to Argentina. Tame carabao were imported from China but they were bred not for meat but milk. Carabao milk was thicker and more palatable than cow milk at the time.

Legaspi’s men discharged firearms causing natives to run. Houses caught fire and with them “much food, which, in short, was the greatest loss, for there was great need of it,” Juan Medina writes. The invaders were hungry, as had been the case with the Magellan crew when Tupás (likely around 23 years old) had already been designated heir to his uncle, Rajah Humabon then Cebu’s leader. Cebu’s food stability was constantly threatened because of its terroir. The quest for food to feed the foreigners would push the Spanish into Panay and other islands. Medina called Panay the “granary of all the islands of [the] archipelago.",Miguel Lopez de Legaspi; Rajah Tupás; Cebu; Panay; Food supply,Juan Medina 50,,,Portrait of Legaspi engraved by Celesti Sadurni i Deop (1849-1896) Public Domain.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/149aQ31_cwE9GD2dCOMMNY0iaKwi70uhO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/149aQ31_cwE9GD2dCOMMNY0iaKwi70uhO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/149aQ31_cwE9GD2dCOMMNY0iaKwi70uhO,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_kX5smHdCU/
coll102,Toxicity,,,"Fr. Medina noted that Taal Lake (then called Bongbong or Bombon) was salty, deep and emptied into the sea. Tunny fish different from the European kind was caught there. Augustinians founded Taal town in 1572, just a year after Manila. When Taal Volcano erupted Fr. Albuquerque built an altar at the foot of the volcano, a procession was made by all town residents and a mass celebrated. Since then no fire or smoke was seen as of 1630. Taal Island about 4 leagues in circuit had fields and cows. Medina noted that Tanauan, Lipa, Bauang and Batangas were founded by his order. “But they have few people [now], so that the presence of the Spaniard must be a poison that finishes them,” he wrote. Taal town likewise had few people but when it was new, “the lake swarmed with [native] people. There was a population issue in Batangas, just as there was in Cebu during Medina’s residence 50 years into colonisation. In future centuries, agriculture took off and population increased in both places. Batangas was known at the turn of the 19th century into the 20th for its cheeses as was Cebu.

coll103,Calumpit Sugarcane,,,"During Medina’s time the Quingua River was a “highway” for missionaries to reach their churches and convents. Calumpit was one day’s journey from Manila down the river and used to be densely populated. Sugarcane was growing during precolonial times. His contemporary Fray Pedro Mejia set up sugar plantations in Calumpit and his co-Augustinian Luis Ronquillo continued the work. It is their order that brought the first sugar presses from Mexico to the Philippines. Called TRAPICHE, the mill originally had two horizontal rollers when it crossed from Iberia to West Africa then Hispaniola (Sto. Domingo today). There Gonzales de Veloso is said to have designed a system so horses could pull the rollers. Sugarcane and its technology were introduced by the Spanish into the rest of the Caribbean and finally Central America. As the TRAPICHE moved into South America, the rollers were positioned vertically and one more was added. In the Philippines carabaos kept the rollers spinning. TRAPICHE began as a mill to extract olive oil before the Middle Ages. The term traces to “trapetum,” Latin for “oil mill. “ Colonialism brought good and bad changes. Sugarcane helped create wealth for natives in later centuries; meanwhile there was depopulation in the 1600s.

Cane is inserted between the spinning rollers; juice runs down canals into a container on the ground (bottom right corner). The juice is cooked till it becomes a syrup before being turned into solid cakes.",Sugarcane; Calumpit; Sugar plantations; Trapiche,Juan Medina 50,,,"“EL TRAPICHE de AZUCAR, Puebla, Mexico.” From portfolio Mexican People, 1947.

coll104,Pampanga Rice,,,"Among the earliest Augustinian mission towns are Betis and Lubao of 1572 and Macabebe and Candaba dated to 1575. Medina writes: Pampanga “is a most fertile land, and we might say that it sustains the country, for it is all rice-fields.” Because it had many residents, Lubao’s church was brick, had a 2-room convent, and 2 assigned religious to service 600 Indians. “All Pampanga is like streets, for the houses of one town are continued by those of another.” Bacolor (established1576) was the best mission of the province. 10 more missions were set up by 1619 around when Medina arrived. Friars were Hispanic culture bearers. Those from Valencia would have been used to rice as their major cereal.
From Manila Bay one can sail past Bulacan to Pampanga Bay where 3 major rivers are found. The southmost is Pampanga River that reaches Candaba swamp and continues into Nueva Ecija. Moving along the coast toward Bataan are the Pasag River (that forks into Guagua River) and Malabag River. Betis is in the Guagua area. The Guagua River heads north to Bacolor. In the 1600s people travelled by boats on waterways that were clean and clear of obstructions. Roadways for horses, carriages and wagons were still in the future.
Hispanic influence of Philippine food depended on close contact between colonisers and the colonised, a consistent sharing of foreign ingredients and techniques, a desire (even if coerced) by the colonised to integrate the foreign, and so many other factors. The mixing of Spanish elements into native cooking was neither instant nor widespread.",Pampanga; Acculturation; Missions; Augustinians,Juan Medina 50,,,"Philippine Atlas, 1959.",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Rwg3HzYM1nwdtX7YGDoQxUZwPHWloE-c,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Rwg3HzYM1nwdtX7YGDoQxUZwPHWloE-c,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Rwg3HzYM1nwdtX7YGDoQxUZwPHWloE-c,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_qxbQhHDI1/
coll105,San Pablo Cattle,,,"Augustinians in San Pablo, Laguna Province managed a good stock farm. From there their Manila convent got 500 head of cattle to replenish an old stock farm with no more animals. During Father Medina’s time, beef remained a favoured food for the Spanish. Perhaps dairy products were made still on a small scale for hospital patients and the Spanish. Cattle (cows, ox, bullocks) were also work animals. San Pablo grew fruit that were “drawn by cattle” to the town of Bay (Bae) on the lakeshore. Chinese and Japanese sampans sailed the fruits from there to Manila’s markets. Laguna also provided betelnut for the capital. Midway through the first century of hispanization, Manila was still the principal market for food products from nearby provinces. Waterway was still the major means of getting around. A typical mission pueblo had around 500 to 1,500 indio residents, 2-3 Spanish religious, and no other resident Spaniard.

Its wooden priorate was “very large, for it has more than 1,000 rich and influential Indians.” From there one could reach Macabebe or Calumpit in two hours by ascending the river. Medina notes that at Agonoy a quantity of wine is made from nipa growing in marshes. If there is nipa wine, nipa vinegar is likely used in cooking. In other sources it is mentioned that Spaniards found local vinegars milder than grape vinegar. Nipa vinegar from Bulacan province acquired commercial status in later years as the native population and its buying power increased.

coll107,San Nicolas Bread,,,"It is unknown when some of the most popular fiesta customs began in the Philippines. The Augustinian church at Macabebe, Pampanga was established in 1575 with the Augustinian from Italy, St. Nicholas of Tolentino (c.1246-1395) as its patron saint. Father Medina provides us a rare date when the September 10 San Nicolas fiesta was celebrated with distribution of blessed bread. While prior at Cebu in 1626, he sent a colleague to preach at Carcar town’s fiesta mass. The preacher earlier had asked the foremost man of the city in both position and wealth to make and provide “little loaves.” We know them as “pan de San Nicolas.” While fancy cookies sporting the holy image in bas relief are what many think of as the Philippine festival “pan,” simple buns were also given to devotees. A cross-marked bread was customary in some European parishes. One’s ration of blessed bread or biscuit is used until the next fiesta to heal anyone who gets sick and to fertilise fields toward a bountiful harvest. The custom strengthens faith as empowerment.
Pan de San Nicolas cookies were decorated in the Philippines with bas relief made using wooden baking cards. We still do not know when that cookie tradition began for sure. I love the fragrance of anise and coconut milk when we bake them at home. Commercial versions lack the anise.

coll108,50 Years of Feeding (Part A),,,"For Spain, Legaspi founded Cebu in 1565 and Manila in 1571. All land with its residents became the King’s. His Majesty decided how to make lands productive and useful. How were the colonials to be fed? Did it affect Indios? Sources of government income included among others food production. One could work and be paid currency so a person could buy food. Simplified, colonial earnings came from: products of encomiendas (estates) around the islands given to Spaniards who fought for the Crown; yearly tributes (taxes) from natives (men); yearly business permits and taxes from Chinese overseas workers and their imports; taxes on goods sold by Spanish traders; annual royal subsidies that arrived when a galleon returned from Mexico. When the latter did not arrive, the colony could not pay its officials, contributions to religious orders, salaries and food of hired natives, salaries of Spanish soldiers and sailors, purchases of food for other government hires and stocking military warehouses. A galleon could be taken by pirates, crash on shoals or in a storm. The government’s economy was unsteady even after 50 years of settlement. While there were some rich Spanish traders who guarded their gains smartly, many colonials learned to live on credit, promising to pay when the annual government fund and sales of exports came and re-booted the economy. Hispanic residents averaging from 1,000 to 2,000 all over the islands were outnumbered by Chinese: 1,000 in 1586; 24,000 in 1597; 15,000 in 1622. Medina notes that Chinese food sellers extended credit to broke colonials. Soldiers on the galleon often were not to be paid the balance of their salary till they returned to Mexico.

coll109,50 Years of Feeding (Part B),,,"Fr. Juan Medina arrived in Manila in 1610. His “Historia” describes the Chinese church as so fine it would be “sightly even in Europe.” The Chinese had capital but they were abused and taxed at the slightest whim. A Chinese wanting to wear a cue, even if Christian, for instance paid to do so annually. But the smart Sangley (Chinese) himself says, “I do not pay this, the Castilian does.” Medina explains: “For since we get our food, clothing and shoes through them, and it is necessary that everything comes from [their] hand, therefore they avenge themselves very well, by putting up prices on everything and shortening measures, so that the loss is greater than is realised.” Medina lamented, “Even when [the Spaniard] is able to get his food gratis [from them]... [he] obtains it at excessive rates because of his lack of consideration or his heedless ways.” Chinese got even when they sold wheat flour, orange preserves, pear, chestnut, ham, dried beef, Chinese chicken, almond and salt imported from their mainland. Spaniards were dependent on them. At the Parian were bakers, butchers, confectioners, sugar vendors and makers of sweets, noodles, wine and more. There were cooks, too, hired by Spanish households. Chinese also planted kitchen gardens with vegetables colonials liked. Chinese added mouths the colony had to feed; the thousands of their own who were residents plus the traders waiting it out for a change in the winds to blow them back to southern China. Colonialism imbalanced whatever food equilibrium there may have been before 1565.

The “China Poblana” inspired Mexican attire at Pueblo. The Asian is said to have arrived on a Manila galleon and was sold in Mexico. Legend says she was an Indian princess in a sari. New claims add she may have been an india of Filipinas.

Military and civil officials stayed only for the duration of their term, as short as two to four years. Native food preparations are listed sometimes in dictionaries compiled by friars. Here are some Tagalog entries for Medina’s era. CQUILAO (kilaw) was fish, deer gut or carabao passed in vinegar seasoned with salt and chili then eaten raw. TAPA meant fish (butterflied) or pieces of meat barbequed. Spanish observed indigenous Caribbeans slowly cook meat wrapped in leaves on a rack made of green wood. The process was called barbacoa. LAMPAHAN meant fish cooked in water with salt, vinegar, chile. SIGANG was to cook rice for eating but outside Manila it was cooking meat or fish. SANGLAL was deer meat, vinegar, chile and coconut oil cooked together. LAOYA was when all ingredients were put in an “olla,” a clay cooking pot. Olla is pronounced close to “oya” — a soft “double L.” Rice became LOGAO when cooked into a porridge with either milk or water. SALABAT was a beverage of sugarcane syrup, water and “spices,” likely referring to ginger. BUCHAYO, a confection, was made with sesame seeds (linga) or coconut. Honey and flour fried in coconut oil was CALAMAY. A “torta” or cake fried in coconut oil was MARHUYA made of honey, flour, water. More foods in the next vignette.

Blanco called it PASITI, noting it was extremely piquant and used in cooking. Today it is known as the Dwarf Wild Pepper Plant.

ASOKAL from azucar, sugarcane sugar. CALUBASA from calabaza, squash. LAOYA from la olla, a clay cooking pot that eventually became the name of a food cooked in the olla. COMPITES from confites, sweets. PANARA from empanada made of fish and other ingredients. SALARA from ensalada. Spanish used papaya to make a common local salad for themselves. Papaya was introduced during colonial times it having originated in Mexico or other parts of the New World. The entry is proof there was papaya in some parts of Tagalog areas in 1600. PRITOS from freyr (freir), to fry. HORNO from horno, the beehive shaped oven used for baking wheat bread. GUISADO from guisado (stew) but meaning to cook rice during the time of Medina. Pedro San Buenaventura, a Franciscan, wrote that because there were no stews in Tagalog cooking, there was no synonym for guisado as Spanish understood their word. LONGANISA for longaniza, a kind of long sausage usually of pork. MANTICA from manteca, pork lard. MASA from masa, dough whether of wheat or rice flour. SOPAS from sopa meaning “soup and bread.” Bread was used to sop up soup remaining in a bowl. Bread as a sopas comes from sopear, to sop up and not from “sopa,” the Spanish word for soup. BACA for vaca, meaning beef or cow. Earlier vignettes confirmed that beef had become a native food but not all the other entries.

A century after Juan Medina’s residence in Filipinas, it seems that introduced papaya was as common as jackfruit.

Filipinos selected not only what grew easily and consistently from among new food plants brought by Spanish (and Chinese), but what they liked to eat. Choice, preference, liking are considerations of inculturation.

coll114,50 Years of Feeding (Part F),,,"Tagalogs made MANHOYA for weddings and grand betrothals during Medina’s era. MANHOYA is described as a “tortilla” (small cake), round, as large as a hand palm, as thick as a finger, kneaded with honey, and fried in coconut oil poured into a rough frying pan. Tlaxcalli (pronounced las-kah-lee) is the indigenous Mexican name for the flat discs of wheat flour or “nixtamal” popularly called tortilla today. Nixtamal is maize soaked in limewater then hulled preparatory to making it dough.
Two other “tortillas” on a 17th century list are TAPAY and LIGIS. Tapay is described as a past participle. When tinatapay or nagtatapay is finished the result is natapay or tinapay. Tapay as a noun is dough that can be made from rice or wheat flour. In 1521, Antonio Pigafetta of Magellan’s circumnavigation crew listed tinapay as a “certain type of rice cake.” Ligis is to prepare dough for a “tamales, pasteles (pie) ó empanada (turnover).” Missionaries found the Philippine equivalent or likeness of Mexican tamal (an ancient corn dough dumpling) that they had seen while waiting for their galleon to Asia. It was the prehispanic SOMAN, glutinous rice cooked while wrapped in leaves (usually banana or buri palm). Similar preparations exist all over insular Southeast Asia and East Asia.
Tamal is an ancient, prehispanic Mexican preparation. The word tamal originated in the Na’huatl tamalii. It was made of corn dough with or without stuffing, was wrapped in corn leaves and cooked by steaming. Pigafetta had recorded preparations like soman made of rice and others of millet (HUMAS in his lexicon). During Medina’s time DAWA was the Tagalog word for millet.
Just as Filipinos have innumerable kinds of soman all over the islands, Mexicans have countless variations of tamal. Both soman and tamal are so securely ingrained in their national cultures that they have contemporary innovations in addition to antique heritage favourites.

Every culture feeds its divinities as well as its people. Mexico served tamal and Filipinas offered soman. Some foods are so securely anchored that contemporary culinary fads may influence them but never cut them off. Cultural identity depends on their security.",Manhoya; Tlaxcalli; Nixtamal; Tapay; Ligis; Soman (suman),Juan Medina 50,,,"From KÁIN NA: An Illustrated Guide to Philippine Food authored by Felice Prudente Sta.

One has to read many independent sources, cull information, and then list what one finds. Some items are not mentioned. Maybe they were not available then or just slipped under the radar. Regarding introduced botanicals, it is safest to presume they may not have been around yet or were still uncommon. Some New World plants were not cultivated till the American colonial era. Here are beans that were around during Medina’s time: BALATONG, CAGIOS, small and red HANTAC, SONGAY. GULAY was the Tagalog word for “legumbres” (vegetables). Among them was a type of MOSTAÇA leaf. It is not clear if it was planted by Chinese kitchen gardeners for their Hispanic clients and themselves or by Indios for their food, or by both. Citrus listed was DAYAP TOTOO, round and small (medicinal for eyes), as well as DAYAP that was slightly larger. Native “naranjas” (oranges) listed include non-orange kinds of citrus: LUCBAN, small and sour SOVA, wild COLONGCOLONG and CAMON, as well as CABUYAO. Not all of those botanicals are around anymore.

coll116,Panay to Iloilo via Passi,,,"Food history in the Philippines begins by studying the coastline and river systems of each island. There were no road networks at the 50th year mark. Father Juan Medina, OSA describes Panay town, the rice-rich community Miguel Lopez de Legaspi moved to in 1569, after almost 3 years in Cebu that lacked food. Panay town is on the northern coast of Panay Island. The Augustinians had a large convent there during Medina’s era. It serviced more than 1,200 indios at the town and visitas. Goods from Manila for military expeditions to Maluco and food supplies were brought to Panay town, thus there were some Spanish residents. The large Panay River nearby was the 2-day route to Mambusao that had a convent. Medina writes that the Panay flows slowly and can be ascended readily. It is deep so a frigate can cross over the bar at full tide. At low tide not even the smallest vessel can enter. After a few days back on the river one sees Dumarag then stops at Dumalág from where Augustinians ministered to 1,000 indios. (Notice the sizes of parish populations then.) Anyone heading to Otong where the fort and port were had to take the Dumalag route. There one could be carried while lying in a hammock or hike to a visita named Batobato. From there travellers descended by river or walked if the water was low to Passi at the island’s interior. The Passi convent was built of stone unlike the others that were of wood. Passi serviced 2,000 indios. A convent generally had only 1 to 2 resident priests. The Alaguer River (Halaud River) flows past the convent gates. One sails on it to Dumangas town (formerly Alaguer) on the coast of Iloilo Strait. Supplies were sailed from there following the coast westward to Iloilo where there were more than 100 Chinese married to native women. He felt the immigrants were arriving so rapidly in town that “they will end up peopling the country.” Salog (Jaro) nearby had 1,000 indios but forced subscription (to row boats to Maluco or to fight slave raiders, for instance) by Spanish lessened the population much. Otong was the chief Augustinian convent of Panay Island. This vignette is shared so readers can better sense how slowly any new foods would have been introduced to natives. Old Panay food will be featured in the next vignette. Towns once important to acculturation can lose their lustre. This describes the importance of rivers for transportation, Christian missionary work, establishment of parishes/pueblos, and food security.

Medina was on Panay Island from at least 1613-1623; Mentrida in 1607 and from 1611. It was not till 1637, the 72nd year of colonisation that Mentrida’s dictionary was published. It was reprinted 204 years later, in 1841. Mentrida collected words from Bisaya, Hiligaynon and Haraya spoken on Panay Island and parts of Cebu. He lists edibles from “sweet water” (meaning not salty) and “rivers”: BIBI, a variety of clam; PASULONGUN (soft G), a kind of shrimp; PAYA, a large shrimp. Perhaps in 1607 they were on the diet.

TOAY is a clam wider than the fresh water BIBI listed in JM20; so perhaps it is also a fresh water fauna. Food was so important a facet of Panay culture that it was given as gifts. The small eel called BOTOTSILI was deemed worthy. Surely other marine delights were left off the lexicon. But what were included provide evidence that indio residents knew what their surroundings offered to sustain life.

CALCAG is to dry under the sun. It can apply to a variety of marine and river protein.

LASO meant garlic along the coast near Ogtong; but in most of Panay it referred to onion.

Cooking fish or meat with or without greens was NAGATOLA. TULAON was used if only greens were being cooked. TOLA is the root word; it also means the cooked preparation. How much of the roster remains not just active but competitively popular in Panay cuisine today? Some words, like tola and its conjugated tinola are used in provinces north and south of Panay.

The world’s peoples share basic cooking processes. Roasting over fire and cooking in a receptacle like a pot are among them.

YAMUC was to salt rice while eating. One scraped off the condiment from a piece of salt shaped like a stone. After a meal, it was not unusual to take something sweet; the practice called HIMALAO.

TABIAYONG was a long, large squash (calabaza) favoured for conserves. There was much to satisfy cravings. Mentrida’s listing is surely just a simple culinary sampler. Food offered pleasure because he found that MACOMACO and NGALONGALO mean to eat with appetite knowing the food is good.

The 1600s provide written evidence that Panay Island residents enjoyed food. Indeed Philippine culture delights in feeding and eating — something to show pride in by caring for it.

The Dutch in 10 galleons met no opposition there because the Spanish alcalde-mayor with his more than 200 Spaniards and 2,000 Indians from encomiendas fled inland. Medina with 2 other missionaries was at the nearby parish of Otong. They buried church valuables, stored others on a caracoa that loyal indios moved to a hidden creek, then fled. The Otong convent lost its ranch of cattle totalling more than 500 head and more than 100 mares. “For as the cattle were tame and came to their usual resorts, the enemy caught some and shot others.” All buildings were torched.
Medina and his Augustinian brothers trudged in the rain to Baong. “Although the convent was poor, yet they (assigned priests) acted as if they were wealthy,” Medina writes. “They shared all the rice and beef of the convent with all the [evacuees likely including natives] who kept coming every moment.” Medina then moved north to Passi where two companies of infantry from Sugbú had arrived as reinforcements. Natives refused to help them initially until the priests started to. The Passi convent like all others served as hosteleries, feeding the military till all their substance was gone. Instead of conscripting indios to increase his troops, the commandant “spent the time in scandalous feasting.” Moving to Dumangas, he and his men gorged on coconuts and sugarcane in “hoggish greed” where “more of them died than if they had fought with the enemy.” While Dutch and Borneans raided the Visayas, in Ilocos, pirates harassed Chinese trading vessels heading to and from Manila.

Medina, however, wrote of Spanish immigrants around the 50th year: Daily our number is lessening, for the country furnishes but little help. [Filipinas] cannot be compared to Nueva España [Mexico], which has enough inhabitants for itself, and to spare. Nothing increases here, or succeeds. The creoles [Spaniards born in the colony] do not reach their majority, and death comes upon them unseasonably.” Women immigrants were few and did not conceive easily.
There were more Spanish living in the southern outskirts of Manila than within the walls. They were all “poor folk, and had native, mestiza or negro women.” Many were sailors, temporary residents, and petty traders. They attended Santiago Church in their vicinity. They abandoned wives and children upon returning to the Americas or the peninsula. Charities and schools were set up by the church to help those forsaken. The King received complaints that Filipinas was not attracting the right kind of Spaniards. The idealised Christian family was being imperiled.

coll125,Finding Comfort,,,"The southernmost church nearest Manila was Malate with one priest who serviced 200 Indians in the early 1600s. Between Santiago and Malate churches was Ermita with 400 Indians in its parish. Both parishes were not Spanish domain unlike Santiago Church. According to law, colonials were not to stray from designated, official places for work and residence.
Understandably, colonials hoped for familiar food. Absence of bread frightened young missionaries. But wheat bread and beef, fundamental to common Spanish home cooking, were introduced as settling began. Olive oil and grape wine were imported regularly. Pork lard was used in frying and local palm vinegars for marinade. Chicken, egg and pork were part of native cuisine making them easy for colonials to secure. In such conditions, Spanish settlers likely would have had guisado (stew) and meats in adobo (marinade) prepared by native partners and cooks whom they taught. Or could they have cooked their home comforts themselves? So far, records of the first 50 years only offer random, cursory peeks into what colonials ate. Being Roman Catholic was synonymous with being Spanish at the time. Christian culinary orientation such as gluttony being a sin and food customs like fasting were settling in among new converts. During this period, natives were becoming Christians not Spaniards.
Philippine cuisine selected Hispanic Empire elements for inclusion gradually over almost four centuries. Missionaries were the first Spaniards into the grass roots. Christian food orientation was an early entry point for Spanish influences.

Native food vocabularies were still barely infused with Spanish and Hispano-American terms. As earlier series show, it was areas near or servicing Intramuros that were already incorporating some Spanish terms.
Back in Panay, Medina’s co-Augustinian Fr. Mentrida gave examples of Chinese words for botanicals mixing. CABUGAO, large oranges, “may have been native or from China.” LUCBAN or UCBAN were small, sweet oranges “from China.” A curious entry is ARLAI, “a seed known and eaten instead of rice.” Was it adlai, a botanical said to be native to Southeast Asia? Three centuries later another Augustinian, Manuel Blanco, wrote that in Filipinas were two species of “Coix lachrima,”Job’s Tears or adlai: ACLAI that was not as hard as TIGBI. The former was eaten as a cooked grain. ARLAI could have been ACLAI. The Chinese picked large quantities of TIGBI from Pangasinan and Calamba, turning it into a flour that they sold. It was good for convalescents and those with delicate constitutions. Blanco may have been referring to what scientists call the soft-shelled “ma-yuen”and the hard-shelled “jobi. ”Today’s Filipino uses aclai and tigbi interchangeably. Food fusions were possible once foreign ingredients became commonly available. No one bothered to remember where the ingredients originated. They became Filipino once they started growing locally.
What are some considerations for food fusions? An ingredient that substitutes for the typical one because the alternative grows better, is cheaper, tastes better, looks better, smells better, is more accessible than the “original”? The two can be twinned in a dish? The foreign or new ingredient is enforced by law or religion?

The five sets of history vignettes in my IG page so far track in as simple a manner as possible Philippine food from the time of Magellan, Legaspi, Dasmariñas, and early Manila galleons. It is Philippine food during the late Renaissance and Reformation, if one adheres to a “classical” timeline. Biographical, first-person stories help re-create the reality of a pioneering colony with insufficient colonisers, local uprisings, foreign attacks, a treasury often depleted, and fear of hunger. Philippine cuisine would claim its share of new global ingredients into the modern era. The next series brings us closer to the 100th year of feeding in Filipinas. Throughout centuries, the expanded narrative reveals that while “deliciosa” and “delicious” joined Filipino vocabularies MALINAMNAM, MANGYAMAN, LAMIAN, NAMITNAMIT and their kin sustain uncontested eminence. The Filipino call to table still remains, KÁIN NA. Let’s eat.

coll128,Culinary Centennial,,,"In 1665, Filipinas had been a Spanish colony for 100 years. Its “conquest” or pacification was still on-going and would not be declared over till the next century.
This series of vignettes establishes what flora and fauna were introduced into Philippine cuisine from foreign domains. The list was compiled from historical sources dating 1521 to 1700. The new elements expanded culinary possibilities for a cooking society using a wide array of traditional Southeast Asian ingredients. The stories also provide the backdrop to appreciating native abilities to transform available ingredients using inherited know-how into flavoursome fare.
It seems that due to contained and constrained interaction between colonials and colonised, Hispanic and Hispano-American influences on native cooking were tepid at the time. The small numbers of Spaniards residing around the archipelago likewise limited popular spread of colonial savors at this cultural junction.Insular Southeast Asian is the foundational culinary ethos of Philippine cuisine.

coll129,"Hello, Caffeine",,,"When Filipinas was approaching its centennial as part of the Spanish Empire in 1665, cacao for planting arrived for the first time. It had a rough voyage departing March 25, 1663 from Acapulco, surviving a tempest, landing at Cape Engaño on Palaui Island (in Cagayan Province) on July 8, and reaching Manila in time for Diego Salcedo, its chaperone, to assume his post as 25th Governor-General of the colony on September 8.
He arrived with 700 hired soldiers, the largest contingent for the 17th century. The annual average was 156 men, mostly convicts and the shanghaied. Recurring instability retarded widespread culinary acculturation and enculturation. On May 5, 1662 for example, renegade Koxinga based at Formosa threatened to attack Manila if it did not pay him tribute. He had 15,000 sampans and formidable fighters for them. Colonial officials refused. Manila had no more than 600 soldiers, only 200 of them able to stand the walls of Intramuros. All soldiers were called in from as far as Zamboanga and Ternate (Maluku, Indonesia). Not even 2,000 could be assembled “and of so many coulours that not even 200 pure [and thus presumably loyal] Spaniards could be picked from them.”
A total of 120,000 cavans of rice plus meat, fish and vegetables were stockpiled inside the city’s walls. As winds and weather became right for war, on January 14, 1663 prayers to combatant patron saint Michael the Archangel commenced. As if a miracle, Koxinga’s death (possibly from malaria) was announced by an ambassador who sailed in offering peace.
Salcedo’s cacao would have found its way to the Jesuit convent having been requested by Juan Davila SJ who was serving in the Visayas. Gaspar de San Agustin, OSA claims the first cacao de Acapulco saplings actually arrived in 1670 brought by naval pilot Pedro Brabo de Laguna. Religious found that drinking cacao (the power drink of Aztec Emperor Montezuma) kept them awake for pre-dawn prayers.
Cacao’s stimulating effect comes from caffeine. It naturally occurs in around 60 plants like tea leaf, coffee bean, kola nut. There appears to be no endemic Philippine culinary botanical with caffeine. Caffeine is an alkaloid like morphine and nicotine.
“Areca catechu” seed has arecoline, an alkaloid. It was chewed in the Philippines, other parts of Asia and the Pacific. Some Spaniards took to it (called BUYO locally) classifying it as a soporific, that which causes sleepiness. Perhaps it was the relaxing postlude after euphoria induced by arecoline that they sought? Cacao originally from Mexico became the pride of Spain.

coll130,By 1610,,,"Flora and fauna introduced during Spanish times, in order to become popular, would need to be accessible regularly (growing locally or imported), able to combine with existing ingredients, provide a substitute when pre-colonial ingredients were unavailable, and be favored by native tastebuds. What follows is a sampling of Insular Southeast Asian ingredients up to 1610 used in Filipino native cuisine. Surely there were more than those on the list, some with and others without historical mention.
First written citations are significant: coconut, 1225, Mindoro with mention of the botanical’s uses first specified in other written sources later; honey, 1515, Luzon; onion, 1225, Mindoro but the type is unidentified and it was definitely not Bombay Onion; rice wine, 1349, Mindanao; sweet potato, 1225, Mindoro but the identity of the tuber is unknown and it likely was not a sweet potato; sugarcane and sugarcane wine, 1349 (the wine was not used in Mindanao, however and there was yet no sugar refining so sugarcane was sucked for its sweet juice). While rice was growing surely in Philippine areas, none of the sources used for this group cite it.
The first circumnavigation reached the Philippines in 1521. Its written narrative includes items in Part A and offers initial evidence that the following were also part of native food in central and southern islands of the archipelago. Some were cultivated while others were foraged and hunted: baghin gourd, banana of many varieties, bat, chicken, chicken egg, coconut (meat, oil, vinegar, water, wine), crab, dorado, dove, emaluan fish, garlic, ginger, goat, laghan sea snail, lemon of native variety, millet, nipa wine, orange of native variety, oyster, panapsapan multicolored fish, panicum, pilax fish, rice, salt, sorghum, swine, tabon egg, timuan red fish, tuber resembling turnip in taste, turtle dove, turtle egg, water, wild boar.

coll131,More by 1610,,,"Pioneering Spanish settlers from different walks of life documented culinary ingredients typical to Insular Southeast Asia that were used by Filipinos. The first colonizers arrived in 1565 on the expedition of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi.

Two sources dated to 1609 are valuable. One is by Antonio Morga, senior auditor of the Manila Audencia (court) who was in Manila from 1595 to 1603. He wrote his book while stationed in Mexico. The other is by a Dominican, Francisco Blancas de San Jose, who also arrived in 1595. Two other examples, but which will not be cited in this vignette, include a Visayan dictionary published in 1841 that augmented an original work from 1637 compiled originally by Alonso P. Mentrida. He was an Augustinian who reached the Philippines in 1598. The other is the first published Spanish-Tagalog dictionary. Pedro de San Buenaventura, a Franciscan, began the project in 1606. Pioneers like them caught native cultures around the islands still unaffected – or if so, barely -- by Spanish ingredients, foods and cooking styles.

In addition to Asian ingredients noted in the previous vignette, “By 1610,” the following were documented: in 1567, tamarind and pepper plants (sent to Mexico), if the latter was sourced in the Philippines is unverified; in 1584 (Mexican report), clove plants sent there, if Philippine grown is unverified. In 1598 the following were noted: mountain buffalo; bred duck (if newly introduced unverified); sun-dried fish (1598).

Sources of 1609 cite the following ingredients in mostly Manila and Tagalog cooking so far not included in #100philipinefood -- like garlic, ginger, sugarcane, vinegar. They reveal the wide range of culinary permutations and combinations offered naturally by existing ecosystems. Surely a lengthy litany of other ingredients was unknown to the 1609 writers. Many of their original entries were written in beautiful and steady penmanship. This is an initial attempt at their transcription and collation. Future researchers can improve on it.

(1) Bivalves: balibis, capiz, cabibi, cohol, halaan, labibin ouac, parus, soso, talaba.

(2) Fish and shellfish: alamang, aligasin medium sie fish, alimango babayi, alimango babayinin, alimango lalaqui, white asojos, calag [dalag], banac, candoli, small cotocoto fish, damis, long and boneless dolong from the lake, dolongasi, dujay (?), very small gagapang fish, hipon (camaron), laulau sardine, talaba, talangtalang, tamban sardine, sauolsauol sardine, salobaybay sardine.

(3) Fruit: alinsanay (wild banana), cabuyao (wild citrus), sour calitcalit likened to grapes that were not found, calubbanan citrus, condol and tabayag when there was no calabasa [squash], catmon, dayap also called colongcolong, lukban [possibly cultivated], lukbang matamis that were small and sweet, paho [local substitute for olive], sampaloc, sungay cambing banana, tanyang anuang banana.

The onion in the document dated 1225 might be LACONA, the “cebolla” of Fr. San Jose. It is described as having “helmets” the size of those like a catmon fruit (Dillenia philippinensis). Catmon is an endemic Philippine tree with edible, spherical green fruit that at present is about 5 to 6 centimeters (1.9 to 2.3 inches) in diameter encased in large fleshy sepals. (Its fruit size may have been smaller in the 13th and 17th centuries.) Perhaps the “helmets” refer to the sepals. Catmon fruit is described as similar in taste to a sour green apple and is used to flavor fish. It is also turned into sauces and sweet jams.

Catmon adds to a rich cache of diverse souring agents available throughout the archipelago. Cuisine is challenged to maximize the use of what is natural to it. Today’s food writers need to highlight the variances in sour tastes Philippine cuisine has. Catmon souring is different from coconut vinegar souring, for instance. Defining, appreciating and sustaining awareness of such nuances are what help to establish native cuisine as having “refinements.”

(4) Pork: babuy, babuy damo the mountain pig, small biyic pig. [There was no beef yet.] (5) Poultry: large dumalaga chicken, malatikling, small pogo. (6) Rice: galapong flour, pinipig, malagquit, buntut pusa, calangcabgan, cquilongquilong, cquinobibi, cumag, gallo, maga[f]ang, mandorugo, maxintic, paua, pinaotong, salungcay.

Pigafetta was the first to describe rice cooked with only water in a bamboo culm, in a clay pot, or wrapped in leaves. He also offers the first written evidence of coconut vinegar, fish served with broth and a separate side of raw ginger, pork served in broth, and roasts.  He found the latter half-cooked and very salty. The Tagalog word SABAO (broth) was written down in 1609, but the source was not published. What follow could be first historical mentions too. Tagalog cooking included BALAOBALAO: placing shrimp in vinegar, washing off the vinegar and flavoring it with honey and salt.  The salt, vinegar and honey combination is called pinagbabalaobalao. It is like kilaw. Fr. San Jose’s might be the earliest description of kilaw, what is spelled CQUILAO: any kind of green placed in vinegar.  He was searching for salad, and concluded natives did not serve it. Cquilao was the closest but while it had vinegar it did not have oil in its dressing. He added that CANGCONG was a green Spaniards had taken to eating with vinegar. Like escabeche, PACSIO could be made and eaten the next day without it having spoiled.  It was fish cooked in vinegar, not just bathed briefly in it and eaten raw as in kilaw. Pacsio was an important native creation. Uses of vinegar were apparent to islanders. There already was SINIGANG defined in 1609 as fish cooked in vinegar, water and salt.  Already with just the four mentioned dishes, sourness has many variances.  Filipino cuisine at its finest can exhibit masterful control of sourness similar to foreign cooking with wine and grape vinegar.",Antonio Pigafetta; Sabao (sabaw); Balaobalao; Cquilao (kilaw); Cangcong (kangkong); Pacsio (paksiw); Sinigang; Cooking (Vinegar),100 Philippine Food,,,"A galleon anchored in Guam on its way to Filipinas, 1590.

Fish like tamban and pork were made into BORO; preserved by dry-salting or brining. BALATOC keeps reappearing in dictionaries from 1609 into the 1800s as the local word for longaniza. Sausages are one means to fully use up an animal; if dried, sausages can last.  But a description of balatoc has remained elusive.
Wrapping items such as fish or fish with rice to be roasted or otherwise cooked (by boiling, for instance) is recorded. CABABAT was food wrapped in palm leaf.
The word tortilla today often brings to mind Mexican thin, flat bread made of corn.  But it is simply a small torta (cake in Spanish) of any sort.

Philippine tortillas cited are CALAMAY of flour and honey; MANRUYA of flour, honey and oil; PINAIS of rice, water and a little honey. Rice flour is the likely ingredient. “Manruya” needs study.  In 1972, JV Panganiban traces marhuya to Mexican maruya, another elusive food that may not exist anymore; Larousse Gastronomia Mexicana and old recipes have no term like it.

coll134,Native Cooking by 1610 (Part C),,,"Another mystery of the era is QUIPING.  It is the local synonym for “hojaldre” that already meant puff pastry in Spain of the 1500s and 1600s.  But “hoja” means leaf.  And quiping is leaf-shaped. Known today as kiping it is the leitmotif of the Pahiyas Fiesta in Lukban and Sariaya, Quezon.  
In 1880 PINAIS was described very similarly to the KIPING of Pahiyas: The dough which is very thin, is poured out on banana leaves and cooked in a pan; then the leaves are taken off and the biscuits are exposed to the sun for a couple of days, after which they are fried in lard or coconut oil. These biscuits… are colored indigo, red, brown, yellow, green, etc. by adding dyeing matter to the dough.  The color green is obtained from the leaves of the sweet potato; the indigo from the indigo plant; the red color from the seeds of the annatto tree.” By 1880 Philippine culinary ingredients included some introduced from Europe and the Americas.
Casubha in 1609 was used by Spanish as the substitute for saffron. Casubha flowers were soaked in water and the colored water used to make food yellow or a fine red.  Whether Filipinos were already using it as a food color before the colonial era is unknown.

The Pahiyas fiesta honours St. Isidore the Laborer, patron of farmers. He was beautified in 1619 and canonised in 1622. Our written evidence for quiping as a pastry is from 1609.

coll135,Native Cooking by 1610 (Part D),,,"The peoples of islands that for the first time would be united (as the Spanish political entity Filipinas) had been evolving independent of each other. They spoke different languages, followed their own religions and leaders.
What offered them similarities were wild plants, fish, and forest animals identified as edible. Similar but not always identical varieties of cultivated botanicals were added to island diets. They are the foundational ingredients of Philippine cuisine, as are some of the ways in which they were prepared.
In 1609 there was SIGANG, fish cooked with salt in water; LAGA, eggs cooked with honey and milk; SANTAN, coconut milk mixed with honey; BOLOTAGAC, coconut milk cooked well with a little salt. That same year, Antonio Morga wrote that natives liked to eat “rotten fish.” Two centuries later, Jose Rizal was incensed by Morga’s comment. He felt Philippine cooking had been insulted. Perhaps Morga meant fermented fish? One form is bagoong.
The earliest appearance of the word BAGOONG in a Philippine historical reference could be 1613. It is defined as fish or shrimp fermented in salt in the entry of Fr. San Buenaventura for “salmuera” (brining solution). Fish and shrimp paste (bagoong) is common in cuisine throughout insular Asian neighbourhoods. It is a flavourer for both cooking and dipping sauce. Bagoong’s byproduct is a liquid that rises to the top of its slush. In the Philippine National Language it is called PATIS.
Romans had a salter sauce similar to patis called “garum” and “liquamen.” They were made with salt plus fish scraps and small fish like smelt, mullet, sprat and wolffish. Mark Kurlansky in SALT writes that Asian sauce developed independent of the European types. Garum was an alternative to plain salt in Roman cooking during the 1st Century BCE, the time of Apicius the gourmand.",Philippine cuisine; Sigang; Laga; Santan; Bolotagac; Salt,100 Philippine Food,,,Insulae Indiae Orientalis (Islands of the East Indies).

coll136,Chile in Adobo,,,"In 1613 the seemingly second oldest written description of CQUILAO (kilaw) became the first one published. While the first is found under ensalada in San Jose’s vocabulary of 1609, the Franciscan missionary Pedro San Buenaventura wrote about it in his 1613 dictionary entry for adobo. Adobo means marinade. The word derives from the French term ADOUBER, to dress a knight in armour. In Spanish it became ADOBAR and took on the additional meaning of dressing meat in vinegar. Something that has been marinating becomes adobado and awaits cooking. The 1609 marinade is vinegar and salt. But in 1613, San Buenaventura describes cquilao as “salt, vinegar, chile pepper into which is put meat, fish, or the gut of deer and set out till tender or eaten raw immediately, outright.” He adds that carabao was also made into cquilao.
Of significance is that San Buenaventura adds chile pepper.
Chile, New World Capsicum, also flavoured LAMPAHAN, fish cooked with water, vinegar and salt.
The earliest evidence of kilaw possibly having been eaten in prehistoric times was found in Butuan by National Museum of the Philippines archaeologists.

coll137,Chile Chronicles,,,"Chile arrived in Asia for the first time during the late 1400s through the Portuguese. They were ahead of the Spanish into the region. Chile was used in India almost as soon as it was introduced. The Indian composer Purandaradasa (1480-1564) called chile “saviour of the poor, enhancer of good food, fiery when bitten.” During the second voyage of Columbus to the Carribean, in 1494, the physician Diego Cheka who was with him, mentioned a hot pepper (Capsicum) seasoned bread, fish and birds at Santo Domingo. In the Carribean, the piquant spice was called AHI or AJI (also spelled AXI). Cheka and Columbus referred to axi as a pepper likely because of chile’s spiciness similar to the familiar black pepper. AHI would become a commodity of trade in Asia.
Fr. San Jose writes in 1609 that while there was no Tagalog word for the Spanish “pimienta” (black pepper), “chile” was called LARA. Linalaraan was to suffer from too much lara. In Malay, “lada sili” means chile. In Magindanao, lada is the term for chile. With the trade and familial links between Borneo with Maynilad and Tundo, one speculates if chile might have been known in some Philippine neighbourhoods before Legaspi’s settling started in 1565. Was lara a take on lada? Chile is a Spanish term derived from Nahuatl’s “chili.”
In 1613, PAMITPIT was recorded as “especias,” meaning spices. If a Spaniard instructed the cook, “Pamitpitan mo,” it meant to throw spices into the cooking. The common ones were black pepper, clove and ginger. They are a European triad. Notice chile of Mexican savour was not included.",Peppers,100 Philippine Food,,,Eugène Delacroix.

Was it for trade and not just consumption by the pioneering settlers of Legaspi’s voyage? Would the dried chile have been planted in Cebu, Capiz and Manila during Legazpi’s stay? It became an ingredient in Philippine cuisine. Perhaps because sources of piquancy were limited to mostly raw gingers, garlic and a variety of onion.
The exact Capsicum variety that arrived in 1565 has not been determined with surety. In the 1800s PASITIS (Capsicum minimum) was the sole chile documented by Fr. Manuel Blanco OSA. Only in Pampanga did the term LARA meaning chile survive by then, he speculated. Since at least 1613 LARA, chile, was used in Tagalog cooking. Pasitis (Capsicum fastigiatum Bl[anco]) is identified by Trinidad Pardo de Tavera in “Plantas medicinales de Filipinas” as the ahi of Cuba and Porto Rico.",Peppers; Pasitis; Lara,100 Philippine Food,,,Pasitis from the grand edition of “Flora de Filipinas” by Father Manuel Blanco (1779-1844) published posthumously as a series from 1877-1883.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1q5x1du1b_ij4UxeLdB5UpEj1_d98rBHW,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1q5x1du1b_ij4UxeLdB5UpEj1_d98rBHW,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1q5x1du1b_ij4UxeLdB5UpEj1_d98rBHW,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDeYu0jn506/
coll139,Pasitis & Wild Chile,,,"Pasitis seems to be an early name for SILING LABUYO (chile that is wild) also called SILING BUNDOK (chile of the mountain). Labuyo is a cultivar of “Capsicum frutescens” rating from 80,000 to 100,000 on the Schoville Scale of heat. The Slow Food Movement put siling labuyo on the international Ark of Taste register as an endangered Philippine heritage food. Labuyo could be a unique version of ahi chile from 1565 with characteristics resulting from Philippine terroir. Labuyo’s fruits grow pointing upwards. Similar looking Thai and Taiwanese chiles (sometimes and sadly passed off and sold as labuyo) like all “Capsicum annuum” fruit point downwards on the plant. Other kinds of chile now grow in the Philippines, some of them introduced during the American colonial era and others even recently. Philippine cuisine cannot be divorced from chile for spicing up vinegars, mashes and relishes, as well as being used in cooked dishes. By 1637 on Panay, sabao was broth but SABAOSABAO was a broth with the Capsicum in it. Broth was sipped while eating rice and fish. In Hiligaynon and Haraya, CATUMBAL became the word for Capsicum. KATIKOT, meaning piquant ginger, was also applied to wild chile.

coll140,Chile & Pepper,,,"One principal objective of Spain’s colonial venture into the Philippines was to find sources of spices desired by Spain and countries forming the European market. Recalling PAMITPIT (documented in 1613 and 1624 Tagalog for all kinds of “spice”), Spanish settlers used the word when they wanted the native cook to add black pepper, clove and ginger in the cooking. Pepper (Piper nigrum) was neither grown nor used in native Philippine cooking at the time. Both San Jose (1609) and San Buenaventura (1613) write there was none in Filipinas. Piper nigrum, black pepper, had to be imported to Filipinas for Spanish residents and trade purposes from Indonesia where it grew well on islands like southern Sumatra. It had been introduced long ago into Indonesia from India where it may have originated around the Malabar Coast. Lada is used as the word for Piper in Indonesia and later was applied to Capsicum (chile) brought by Portuguese. Cabé is another word for Capsicum in Indonesia and Malaysia and has overtaken lada in some areas. Capsicum frutescens (labuyo or pasitis) is called Cabé Rawit.
By at least 1754 and into 1860, LARÁ in Tagalog meant both chile and pepper. One attempt to grow Piper nigrum in the Philippines was sponsored by the Royal Philippine Company in the 1780s. The progressive Governor-General Jose Basco offered awards to those who would cultivate pepper as well as cinnamon and nutmeg for the export market. Efforts in agriculture for export did not find sufficient support from Spanish residents. When the galleon trade ended in 1815, efforts to increase agricultural profit were revived. Fr. Manuel Blanco’s “Flora de Filipinas” (editions published from 1837 to 1883) wrote that by then, “Everyone” knew black pepper, sometimes called “malisa.” Jean Mallat who lived in Manila from 1840 to 1846 observed that natives got tired of harvesting minute peppercorn and gave up the plant for cultivation of coffee. When black pepper started to become an ingredient for Philippine food remains to be verified. Home economics introduced to the Philippines in 1904 often included in native and American recipes the instruction: “Add salt and pepper.” Chile and pepper added piquancy to native food that before western influence came from raw garlic, gingers and indigenous varieties of onion.",Spices; Peppers; Pamitpit,100 Philippine Food,,,Piper nigrum from “freepik.com”,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,public domain,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iC1FUq8lH6jF_LYfTmT23-258iGKoyxf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iC1FUq8lH6jF_LYfTmT23-258iGKoyxf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iC1FUq8lH6jF_LYfTmT23-258iGKoyxf,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDwQf0pnYa6/
coll141,Baka & Quiso (Part A),,,"Mitsado and bulalo were not documented as being in the vocabulary of native cooks during the first century of Spanish colonisation. There is no evidence they cooked those dishes yet. But the words baka (from Spanish “vaca”) for cow and quiso (from “queso”) for cheese appeared in Tagalog for the first time already. Before the 40th year of the Conquista, 24 cows and 2 bulls arrived by galleon from Mexico to begin the Philippine breeding farm. The King had underwritten their cost and transport.
Cows were unknown in Mexico and the rest of the Americas until 1493 when Columbus left on his second trip to the Carribean and introduced them first there. They created American Creole cattle, the term for a cow of pure Iberian parents but born in the colony. American Creole cows became so hardy and populous.
Whereas western European countries used cows for dairy and traction, according to the research of Marleen Felius, et. al. (2014), Spain since the Reconquista of 900 to 1492 began developing thriving cattle ranching in Castilia and Andalusia. Herds had 1,000 to 15,000 heads and were used as work and beef cattle.
Although a total of less than 1,000 Iberian cattle reached the Americas, according to research cited by Amparo Martinez, et. al., great herds thrived. One wonders if any traces of American Creole cattle remain in the Philippines.
During the first century of colonisation cows were also imported from China. Their milk was preferred to that of New World cows. Over centuries, especially during the 20th century, different types of cows such as the Indian Zebu with a hump and varieties from Australia were introduced to the Philippines. Or were they the Chinese cows brought in during the Spanish call to begin cattle raising and dairy production?",Cows; Baka; Cheese; Quiso; Cattle,100 Philippine Food,,,American Creole cows. shutterstock.com,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mn8WeedyQGWI7y-Dmv17m0jC644GPBTx,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mn8WeedyQGWI7y-Dmv17m0jC644GPBTx,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mn8WeedyQGWI7y-Dmv17m0jC644GPBTx,https://www.instagram.com/p/CD37b8CnUmH/
coll142,Baka & Quiso (Part B),,,"At first natives did not like the taste of beef, according to missionaries some of who managed ranches of 1,000 head for their orders. One wonders what beef dishes the missionaries introduced that changed the minds of their islander parishioners. There was no refrigeration so a cow (like a large domesticated pig or a wild boar) had to be eaten or turned into jerky (tapa) right away. “Tapa” is a native term recorded in 1613 as the Tagalog synonym for the Spanish “ahumar” and “secar.” Lukmâ, meaning thin tapa at the time, has slipped away from contemporary usage. Price controls many years later, in 1828, included tapa made of carabao, cow and deer meat, the latter being the most costly and the first the cheapest.
Beef is synonymous with Spanish culture. By 1891 there were over 400,000 head of bovine in the colony. That year Masbate had over 65,000 head and Negros Occidental over 62,000 leading insular herds.
Not only was beef popular for meat but as a source of cheese.
The best cheese at the time was made in Cebu.
Cheese was not only a desired food but a military ration. Bread and cheese were needed by sailors and soldiers with no time to stop for a meal in the middle of a typhoon or a fight.
In USA records of 1902 cheese was described as “made in small quantities, that coming from Cebu and Laguna being of excellent quality.” It was noted that the former was “famous throughout the archipelago.”
One wonders when natives began eating quiso. A curious table from 1902 notes that natives and Chinese bought neither fresh Philippine cheese nor European cheese. They were eaten by “whites” paying 20 cents per pound for local cheese made in a “most primitive manner” and 37-1/2 cents for the imported variety. Today, Filipinos are very fond of native white cheese made of cow or carabao milk, as well as a diversity of European kinds some already made in Davao and UP Los Baños.

coll179,A New 100 Years Begins,,2021-01-27,"In 1665 when the second century of Filipinas as a Spanish colony began, there were four groups being fed: the colonisers; the Christianised natives; the Chinese traders and overseas migrant workers; and the pagans.
The Conquista (Conquest) was still on-going. The archipelago had not been pacified fully. Areas had not been reached and among those that had, there were revolts ignited by abuses, some of them because they threatened the food supply. Raids by Borneans and Dutch furthered instability.
The colony was in need of Spanish settlers to develop the islands. Instead they came wanting to make a fortune from the galleon trade and then leave. Even Spanish farmers given privileges by the Crown opted to trade. Promising lands mostly remained uncultivated.
Indios had to provide the colonisers and themselves food. Parishes founded by missionaries aided food security. Chinese were brought in to increase the food supply by cultivating kitchen gardens, labouring in fields, salt farming, baking bread, and importing temperate clime culinary supplies. The Chinese had to feed themselves and as they became Christian and married indias, they strengthened the colony’s food providing capacity. Pagans continued to live off the land with some cultivation in their territories. Interaction among the four groups was meagre with missionaries being the common link at this point in time.",Philippines -- History -- 1521-1896; Philippines -- Colonization; Food security; Labor;,100 minus 8,,,"Protection of Manila, meaning the walled-in city now a tourist attraction, was the foremost concern.

coll180,Catholic Cuisine,,2021-01-30,"Into the second century of Philippine colonisation missionaries were still trying to convert natives. Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits and Recollects were implementing a system that divided up the archipelago among them. No Spanish lay were allowed to live with natives yet. Spanish military were confined to forts. Only priests, and there was a shortage of them, interacted with natives.
It was during church festivals that missionaries shared food with their flock. The practice was to have sweets and some wine, native and/or Spanish to make fiestas special. Precolonial festival foods and simple Spanish festival foods were both served: coloured rice dishes; pork. Into the start of the second colonial century, natives were exposed by priests to Spanish Christian cuisine and its customs. Natives learned to bless food, abstain, fast, and feast as Catholics. Secular Spanish culture was yet to spread beyond Manila. Such was the general setting into which our stories will open.

The vendaval was too strong so the galleon could not reach Cavite. Fr. Melchor de los Reyes, a Jesuit born in Puerto Rico was the Palapa parish missionary. He suddenly had 80 persons to house and feed! Dominicans numbered 39 and all were from Spain. He received his brothers in Christ with bell ringing, the playing of wind instruments, and other music. Some slept in the choir loft and others in galleries. There was a clear river where they could bath, books in great abundance, and food always plenty, clean and served punctually.
 It was presumed the group could leave in boats within a few days or that the galleon could continue its voyage.  The priest found food to provision the ship and alerted Jesuits in neighboring areas of the dilemma. Not till 7 months later, in March the next year could his guests depart due to unsafe weather!  Such was life at a time when people knew climate mattered.
It was the religious who provided free board and lodging to all who needed them.  Simple Spanish dishes could have been added to what native cooks roasted and prepared in metal pans and clay pots. New World ingredients were being accepted into common Spanish cuisine gradually since the Columbian voyage of 1492. Some like tomato, chili and corn grew in different areas of Filipinas since the first colonial century.","Cooking, Spanish; Melchor de los Reyes; Catholic Church -- Missions -- Philippines; Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Social life and customs; Crops -- Philippines; Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Religious life and customs;",100 minus 8,,,"Port of Palapa in July 1789 -- 120 years after the Concepcion voyage.

It was suggested he use it to partially pay porters and cooks.  But the Jesuit refused resolutely. The priests of his domain came with whatever supplies they could to feed the 80 unexpected guests.  He gave thanks that “nothing was owed the Indians” and that his pantry was always full.  It was considered a miracle that two dugong had been caught, “a thing which had not been seen before…for it was .. a great miracle.” Each one, if adult, may have been about 2.6 meters long weighing 300 kilos. Perhaps the marine mammals were preserved with salt or by sun-drying or smoking? The sea-grass eating Dugong dugon is related to manatees and sea cows. It has been hunted since prehistoric times for its meat, oil, skin and bones. There is a 5,000-year-old, Neolithic painting of dugong in Tambun Cave, Ipoh, Malaysia.  Some think it is the inspiration for mermaids.","Dugong; Cooking, Spanish; Catholic Church -- Missions -- Philippines;",100 minus 8,,,"Read “The Dugong Debacle” about the importance of sea grass meadows in SafariNews.

Upon reaching Manila, they all praised Fr. Melchor “reared in so holy a school as that of the Society of Jesus – where, although one is taught all kinds of knowledge completely, we can say that charity is that which is not taught, because it is inspired.” It took them 2 months to reach the capital due to bad weather. Upon reaching Luzon, they began their long walk over difficult roads and pathways, none paved at the time. Thankfully they made stops at Franciscan missions. In 1665 there were just over 70 missions in the entire archipelago. New missionaries would bring their religion into far off pagan areas where there was still head-hunting, take the place of elder missionaries who could no longer remain in health-challenging environs, fill long vacancies at missions where new Christians could revert to paganism, and also teach in the convents of Intramuros.  In the late 1600s, missionaries were still impassioned by the asceticism and zeal of the late Renaissance and Counter Reformation movement. Simple Spanish cuisine reached native communities where priests proselytised. Philippine cuisine did not yet have sufficient access to foreign influences it could react to.","Catholic Church -- Missions -- Philippines; Melchor de los Reyes; Cooking, Spanish; Philippines -- Colonial Influence;",100 minus 8,,,"Frontispiece of the book from where our food vignette was taken: La Historia de la Provincia del Santo Rosario de Filipinas, Japan y China del Sagrado Orden de Predicadores.

In 1665, the year Filipinas began its 101st year as a colony, Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P. was arrested in China for his missionary work and deported. Intending to return to Filipinas where he had taught theology at UST and served in Bataan and Mindoro, he instead found himself in Spain and a new assignment in the New World, Sto. Domingo. In 1676 his book “Tratados historicos, politicos, ethicos, y religiosos de la monarchia de China” was published. (Tratados means “treatises”.) In it he recounts discovering in the mountains of Bataan the “famous fruit considered as a delicacy in China, which is called lechias by the Spaniards and li chi by the Chinese”. He called it (Euphoria litchi) one of the best fruits in the world. The fresh ones he brought to Manila “were the first fresh ones that have been in that city; for those taken thither from China are dried and do not at all resemble the fresh ones.” He ventured that Chinese consider it the queen of fruits. “They are small, being slightly larger than a large nut, and the shell is green and thin. The inside is as white as snow, and it has a kernel in the middle as black as jet. Its savor, taste and odour make one praise the Creator”. The fruit of Chinese origin was growing wild in Bataan where natives called it alipai. Drying lychee extended its edibility and use in cooking.

He added that NANGKA is the “best fruit in the world”with some of them weighing over 40 libras (28 pounds) each. Its nuts or seeds were savoury when eaten raw or roasted. The Dominican, like other missionaries, called ATES (Anona squamosa L.) the “most superior of all the fruits God created” because of its aroma and taste. As the second colonial century started GUAVA (Psidium guayava) introduced from America had spread so fast it was destroying the pasteurage of cattle that in some areas multiplied greatly. Crows and other birds ate the fruit and dropped the stones to the ground where they took root. Guava was eaten raw or cooked into desired preserves and jellies. (Archaeological digs dated before Spanish settlement reveal guava seeds that could be a Philippine or Asian variety.) PAPAYA from the New World was growing well.

coll186,Creole Cuisine,,2021-02-20,"One rare and important observation by Fr. Domingo Navarrete OP is that indios and creoles both used the residue from making coconut oil in cooking a “very savoury dish with rice”. He adds no description of the dish, however. A creole was a person of pure Spanish blood born in a colony. Those born in Filipinas were known as insulares (islanders) or Filipinos. The natives of Filipinas were called indios. Coconut was a common denominator in at least one food eaten by indios and the Spanish of Manila, and perhaps other parts of the islands. Native wine, likely tuba from coconut inflorescence sap, was mixed with Spanish wine already in the first century as a colonial’s drink. (Refer to #100philippinefood.) Navarrete notes that coconut water when coconut meat is sweet and tender is a healthful beverage. Cocoanut was roasted for the sick, and “after it settled the said water is drunk and produces excellent results.” He offers written evidence of how natives used coconut milk to “cook many of their eatables, among these their rice.” He classifies buchayo as an excellent native conserve. The Spanish were gaining knowledge of islander food and finding those they liked. Culinary experiences in a colonial environment are a two-way discovery by colonial and native of each other’s food customs.","Cooking, Creole; Cooking (Coconut); Wine and wine making -- Philippines; Filipinos;",100 minus 8,,,"Coconut Palm.

coll187,Eat Like Indios,,2021-02-24,"Father Domingo Fernandez Navarrete, whose experiences are used for this set of vignettes left Filipinas for China 8 years before 1665 when the second century of Filipinas as a colony began. His book was released in 1676, 11 years into the new century. The missionary challenges he records remained into the 1700s. Navarrete and his companions, for example walked from Calavit uphill to Guistin in Mindoro over jagged rocks that wore out their soles. The bare feet of his Indian companions bled “causing us to overflow with compassion”. They clambered up slopes holding roots. For supper they had a small bit of biscuit soaked in a trifle of mass wine which they also drank for fear of the cold. Natives shared eggs, rice, potatoes. They killed a carabao near a spring and cut it into pieces on the spot to sun-dry. Some of the places they reached had not celebrated mass in 2 to 3 years; no Cura had set foot in others for 14 years. Yet in Mindoro all the Indian villages were full of crosses set up with great neatness. The locals were hospitable. Dugong (mentioned in earlier vignettes) was native food and its bones used to make rosaries. The roe of skate was salted for food. On Bacco Island they were treated to a meal of ray fish. Its liver was considered a finest native delicacy. The Spanish discovered and liked it. To survive, foreigners needed to eat local foods.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.; Hiking; Dominicans -- Missions; Water buffalo; Mount Calavite (Occidental Mindoro, Philippines); Cooking, Spanish; Baco Island (Oriental Mindoro, Philippines);",100 minus 8,,,Ray fish.

Annual figures reveal how limited and slow was the impact of Spanish soldiers on native cuisine during this era. Our current focus begins in 1665 and the figures for soldiers before it hardly differ from 1670 and 1672. (The exception was 1663 when Governor-General Salcedo arrived with 700 paid soldiers.) The 2,200 minimum military force of pure blooded Spanish was not met. The total figure of Spanish soldiers in Manila were 708 in 1670 and 667 in 1673; Fort Santiago 86, 81; Cavite 225, 211; for both years Cagayan 155, Calamianes 73, Caraga 81, Cebu 145, Oton 169. The annual number of new soldiers wanted was 300 but on the average only 156 came and there were years such as 1686-1688, 1692-1693 when no soldiers arrived. The majority sent were convicts not career military. In the 1650s soldiers from Cavite and Manila roamed the countryside robbing indios because they had not been paid in years. For decades soldiers ate on credit at the Parian or lived with indio women. Like friars, soldiers succumbed to tropical climate and illness. There were clearly limits to indios experiencing Spanish cuisine during this period.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.; Philippines -- History -- 1521-1896; Spain -- Colonies -- History, Military; Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Social life and customs;",100 minus 8,,,"A “morion,” meaning Spanish metal helmet.

coll189,Unusual Food,,2021-03-03,"Navarrete confirms that the ancient trade of Philippine edible birds’ nests with China was on-going. We wonder if he tried bird’s nest soup. He wrote, “When cooked with meat [the nests] are a marvel and contain much nourishment. They are given as presents in Manila.” The expensive nests of swiftlets were extracted by hand from craggy limestone rock faces, caves and cliffs. The Calamianes in Palawan have been famous for the product. The nests are made from dried bird saliva and resemble ash-coloured earth often with some feathers and twigs. But when cleaned they become white. (There are naturally orangey and reddish nests too.) Once softened the nests become gelatinous and are a favourite ingredient for nutritious soups that have been a part of Chinese cuisine for at least 400 years. The Portuguese included edible birds nests from Siam and Cambodia among their goods for the Chinese market. Navarrete must have been proud of his knowledge about Asia, an exotic realm.

Residents from several long-established barangays had to be convinced to relocate and create a parish. The parish was built with a central square plaza. The church was on one side and the government administrative office on another. Leaders could build their houses on the other two sides. Once firmly established the religious parish could be made a civil entity, a town. Public management was easier with people gathered in one place rather than scattered. Priests found it easier to enforce church education, festivals, tithing, church building and cleaning. By law no one could leave a parish, even temporarily without permission from the parish priest. But a town also made it easier for the tribute collector to gather the rice, textile and, later, coin due the King. Natives preferred to stay far away. Missionaries followed model Spanish town planning. Each family was given an identical amount of land to live and raise food on. They did not own the land. The King owned everything.

No indios wrote recipes, cookbooks, menu cards, market receipts, food business or restaurant biographies during the first two centuries of the colonial era. The historical food narrative has to be pieced together using official documents and writings by government officials, missionaries, travellers and, as in this new series, even a pirate. Charles Swan was given command of the sailing ship Cygnet to trade British goods in the New World. Instead he joined up with a pirate and raided ships along the American coastline. While likely in the waters of Jalisco, he desired to head into Asia. But the Pacific crossing was notorious. The crew knew the extreme hunger and death from scurvy that Magellan and his men experienced in 1521. The Cygnet’s provisions would not last 60 days even with rations cut to half a pint of maiz daily. Salted jewfish (Atlantic goliath grouper) was the only other food on board. The big-bodied fish had sweet meat and fat. Jews in Jamaica ate them freely because the fish has scales and fins required by Levitical Law. Of all Swan’s arguments that which convinced the crew was his promise to cruise off Manila. The city’s wealth had become mythic. Ships with pieces of eight and silks could be captured. On March 31, 1686 Cygnet raised anchor. Swan increased the food ration from 8 spoonfuls of boiled maiz daily to 10 per man as they sailed with the trade winds.

Everything from sardines to iron was brought for the mission post that started in 1668 and, constructed in 1671, a protective fort. By 1680 a Spanish settlement was being set up for galleons. It was a forlorn post to where exiles and prisoners were sent. An official could threaten anyone making passes at his wife with a sentence to the Marianas. Eventually Chamorros, the resident islanders, had to work two times weekly on government projects that included salt making by women and hunting wild boar by men. Other labors were onerous. Socorro (meaning “relief”) was the annual assistance of goods like food, coin, men to aid the community of Hagatma at the middle of Guam Island, on its west coast.

The Spanish Governor was living at the southend of the island (likely Umatac) and was able to warn the incoming galleon, San Telmo, to stay out of Swan’s site. The Governor replied in a letter later that morning that he appreciated the gifts and would send what provisions “he could possibly spare”. As a token of gratitude he sent 6 hogs, 12 musk melons, many watermelons, and ordered natives at a village near where Swan was anchored to “bake every day as much of the breadfruit as [Swan desired],” and help the visitors get coconuts.

coll197,Coconut Wine Rivals,,2021-03-24,"Sri Lanka makes wine from coconut flower inflorescence in an ancient manner and is promoting it on the international scene like the Philippines. Coconut wine is a product shared by the coconut growing areas of Asia. Dampier described the use of coconut to make wine, just as did Antonio Pigafetta of the circumnavigation crew in 1521. Dampier’s “toddy” looked like “whey”. He wrote: It is sweet and pleasant, but is to be drunk within 24 hours after it is drawn, for afterwards it grows sour. Of all the East Indies native wines much esteemed for making Punch, toddy using sap from the coconut tree made the most delicate.
He recommended adding a dash of brandy because toddy (known as arack; also according to Pigafetta, uraca and tuba) alone did not make good Punch. The duet was chiefly used in Goa and was called Goa Arack. Instead of hanging a bamboo pitcher as Filipinos do, Goans used a “Callabash” with a hole hung on the coconut tree. Coconut cooking and wine-making link the Philippines to its neighbouring nations. An Asian coconut cooking book that includes antique and contemporary uses of tuba should be interesting for world foodies. Arack and alak trace to the Arabic arrack (distillation) and one hopes to learn how the term became so well established in Filipinas.

Island native ingredients however were still popular. (Refer to #100philippinefood @felicepstamaria.) When Dampier had abandoned his pirate life and wrote his travel book he described different ways coconut milk was used in Asia. He recorded boiling fowl or any other sort of flesh in coconut milk to make a savoury broth. English seamen had learned from islanders to boil rice with coconut milk and therefore carried coconuts during voyages. By his era the greatest use of coconut was to make “Oyl both for illumination and for frying. The way to make the Oyl is to rasp the kernel, and steep it in fresh water; then boil it, and scum off the Oyl at the top as it rises: But the Nuts that make the Oyl ought to be a long time gathered, so as that the kernel may be turning soft and oily.”
When potable water is unavailable, scarce, or being rationed the coconut has provided liquid for quenching thirst and cooking. Currently a new generation of coconut seedlings need to be planted to aid food security. While Pigafetta in 1521 during the first circumnavigation wrote about coconut water and coconut trees that live to be 100 years old, it seems a tree is most productive for only 30 years.

He would be kept aboard until the Guam Governor provided sufficient provisions. Among the first food sent to Captain Swan were small hogs that had excellent meat. They were fed coconuts and their flesh was the sturdy texture of beef brisket. A polite and courteous exchange of letters began. The Governor sent two hogs and fruit daily for which he asked in exchange powder shot and arms. He also asked for a large English dog that was like a pet for Swan’s crew. The Spanish official received everything he asked for. On May 30, though, the Governor sent his last gift: several hogs, a jar of pickled mangoes [likely the small, wild growing Philippine “paho” used as the local substitute for olive], a jar of excellent pickled fish, a jar of bread made from fine wheat flour but that was not baked hard like sea biscuit. He also sent 6 to 7 packs of rice. His letter asked that he be “excused from sending any more provision ... [as] he had no more on the Island that he could spare”. He also sent word that the West Monsoon was at hand, that therefore according to Dampier, “it behooved us to be jogging from hence, unless we were resolved to return back to America again”. Swan said his thanks and sent the friar (hostaged since May 21) ashore with gifts for him: a large brass clock, an astrolabe, and a large telescope. The priest gave the pirates 6 hogs, a roasting pig, 3 or 4 bushels of potatoes, and 50 pounds of Manila tobacco. The pirates had also secured as many coconuts as they could stow, a good stock of rice, and 50 hogs preserved in salt.

[Nipa palms likely.] Sago was a native staple food for 3-4 months. The tree’s pith is beaten lustily with a wooden pestle in a great mortar or trough after which it is collected in a cloth and held over the trough. Water is poured and the muddy substance collected below is made into cakes serving as bread. Sago was eaten similarly at all the Spice Islands. It was also dried into small pieces resembling seeds that were commonly eaten with almond milk (there is a Javanese almond) to cure those stricken by flux (discharge like diarrhea or even blood). Dampier did not realise yet that sago flour is made from several types of palms including buri. It figures in the Austronesian migration period of the Philippines particularly from the late third and second millennium BC. The SAGHU noted by Pigafetta in Tidore of 1521 may have been from black-thorned “Cycas revolta”. At that time Borneo traded sago as solid loaves. Precolonial sago would have figured in food preparations like BENIGNITY, SALAB, TAMPING, and PALAGSING.

Dampier described Mindanao as growing a tree as large as an apple tree with fruit growing directly on the boughs like cacao fruit. He meant the durian that always made for a good story. The fruit “is about the bigness of a large pumpkin and covered with a thick green rough rind.” One wonders why he did not mention that the fruit is surrounded by sharp spikes. “When it is ripe,” he explains, “the rind begins to turn yellow, but it is not fit to eat till it opens at the top.” The ripe fruit inside sends forth an “excellent scent”. Once the rind opens, the durian fruit is quartered. Each quarter has several small cells, the largest as big as a pullet’s egg. “It is as white as milk and as soft as cream, and the taste very delicious to those who are accustomed to them; but those who have not been used to eat them, will dislike them at first because they smell like roasted onions.” Durian can only be eaten at its prime. Over a day or two the fruit blackens and spoils. Its seeds are roasted, peeled and eaten like chestnut, wrote the pirate.

That was Captain Charles Swan whose expedition sheds insight into food at the start of the second Philippine colonial century. His arrival in Mindanao of 1686 coincided with the westerlies that bring rain and typhoons. The winds so rage that the biggest trees are torn up and are carried into the sea by rivers that overflow their banks. At the southeast end of Mindanao they took shelter in a deep bay on July 4. Again in need of food, the pirates were lucky. The adjacent savannah “abounds with long grass, and it is plentifully stock’d with deer,” wrote Dampier. “The deer live here pretty peacefully and unmolested, for there are no inhabitants on that side of the bay. We visited this Savannah every morning, and killed as many deer as we pleased, sometimes 16 or 18 in a day; and we did eat nothing but venison all the time we stayed.” They were anchored there for 12 days. Archaeological research suggests that deer was part of the prehistoric Philippine diet. Deer was suited to life in flat lands. Wild boar thrived in thick forests.

Villagers pointed to “Mindanao City” situated at a river of the same name. Once there they anchored and fired 7 or 9 guns and were answered by 3 guns fired from shore. Swan fired once and a canoa with 10 rowers approached. In it was Rajah Laut (the Maguindanao Sultan’s brother) who demanded in Spanish who they were. “English,” replied Mr. Smith, a prisoner that had taken at Leon, Mexico. The Rajah brothers wanted English to settle in their realm and bring in trade profits. No longer were the Portuguese their enemy but the Spanish and the Dutch. Swan was granted hospitality that extended for the entire season of westerly tempests.

They celebrated Christmas on board with a lunch of buffalo. His men went hunting having been promised there would be herds of cattle they could use as provisions. The natives had no hunting dogs and it seemed the story of abundant beef nearby was a ruse just to keep the crew around. A third had been living with the natives and lavishing payment (using even gold) for food, company, servants, and rent. As it became obvious that the foreigners were restless, the rajah shocked Swan by demanding payment for all the meals he had consumed since July. The easterlies had settled in and it was the only wind that could carry the ship to the Spiceries. Swan seemed indifferent to his men who wanted action. They were bored. His personal journal that insulted some of his men was found and his men gave him an ultimatum. Instead of addressing the issue with dominance and firmness, he let the situation fester. On January 14, Swan with around 36 of his men who had merchant inclinations were left ashore. The rest of the crew set sail to plunder in Manila! When they got to Zamboanga there were great tracts of hogs and cattle. The sailors had eaten the sweet flesh of green turtle. They saw huge bats, manatees but no fish near Guimaras. At Mindoro by February 18 they found again great herds of hogs and beef. The latter seemed to be a mix of Asian and American breeds. Within the first 40 years of Manila as a Spanish citadel, European cattle from Mexico had been introduced along with ranching. Clearly in 1686 the efforts were paying off. The pirates, now under the command of Captain Read, did not go hungry.

It also carried cotton cloth to make sails. The pirates saw Luzon’s savannahs well stocked with cattle, especially buffalo. The natives lived in towns. Manila Bay was large enough to take hundreds of ships. Usually there were 20 to 40 Chinese “jonks”.

Rice boiled in water or sago and a small fish or two made up the common food in Mindanao (Maguindanao). Meat was for the better-off. Spoons were not used.

There were tame duck and hen as well as wild bat, boar, buffalo, cow, deer, varieties of fish, locust, manatee, pidgeon, sea turtle. There was also goat and swine. Wine was made from coconut or sugarcane. Water was the beverage at meals in Mindanao. Locust was toasted in a pan and grass from goat innards boiled at Batanes. Raw fish was eaten there, too. Spanish made pickled fish and pickled mango (the small paho kind resembling an olive). They baked bread using wheat flour.

Unripe its fruit was “used in marinating other dishes.” Its taste was like that of a “good peach but with greater fragrance.” The tree was “brought in from abroad, but here it grows so well that it seems to be in its own native environment.” The pajo looked “very much like the manga, except that it is small.” It was “only served steeped in brine, forming a substitute for olive.” Such was noted quite early in the first century of colonisation. The friar continues: “It is tasty and is a good appetite. It is given to the sick to increase their appetite and the indios like it very much.” It was paho brined rather than pickled perhaps that the pirates traveling with Swan and Dampier were given in Guam prior to their Mindanao visit.

coll212,Nipa-sasa,,2021-05-12,"San Antonio’s chronicles offer a glimpse into Philippine food in the 150th year of Filipinas as a colony. The wine “most commonly used by the indios, which is most healthful for the Spaniards, is that made from a palm called nipa by the Visayas and sasa by the Tagalogs.” It thrived in brackish water along riverbanks. Sap was gathered from the inflorescence and distilled using fire. The result was spirits milder than that of European wines but good for the health if used moderately. Tuba from coconut he considered “stronger and better” than nipa wine. Even “more refreshing.” San Antonio added that “There is no lack of European wine”. There was a Mexican wine made from herbs brought in, but it gave Spaniards “verven” (like dropsy) that killed them. Water not wine was had with meals. Wine was for toasting for a special event or feast. He added that native wines complemented the imported Spanish ones, “specially if blended with them or other healthy and tasty spices.” One senses Spanish cuisine developing colonial changes.

coll213,Distinctions,,2021-05-14,"Fr. San Antonio described “balimbin” as like a large “friar plum” that was oblong rather than globular in shape. The tropical Southeast Asian botanical along with other cultigens for coconut, lanzones and santol is now said to have been introduced by ancient Austronesians. Balimbin fruited all year round. “Its preserve, whether dried or in syrup, is in great demand here [Filipinas] and in New Spain.” One wonders if culinary interest in them can be resurrected? While still unripe, balimbin was sour and used as a condiment. A variety imported for planting from Terrenate [Indonesia] grew large fruit eaten when ripe for their exceptional sweetness. In the colony’s 150th year culinary and medicinal values of native botanicals had become familiar to missionaries. Up to this period only religious were allowed by law to live and mix with the indios. San Antonio could still distinguish what plants came from Spain (grapes from Parras; small lemons from Ceuta) and from the New World (atis, anonas, zapotes, chicozapotes, chirinoyas, papayas).

coll214,Fruits of Divine Providence,,2021-05-15,"Fr. San Antonio praised the fruits growing all over in the mid-1700s. He found the big “santor” tree resembling Spain’s walnut tree in size. It was made into preserves, dried in the sun, salted, and stewed. “It is very abundantly and very much in demand by the indio who has a preference for sour fruits,” he added. Camias was also sour. Natives ate them sliced small in their juice; Spaniards ate them preserved like balimbin. The “duhat” resembled an olive and was seasoned or marinated similarly. Pineapple had already adapted to Philippine terroir from its home in the New World. San Antonio explained it is soaked in water and eaten with a little salt to counter colic. [The same habit was reported in the Caribbean. Pineapple may have originated in Brazil.] Salt made in Manila was as “fine, white and safe as that from Spain”; indio-made salt was said to be harmful. Manila salt was made by Chinese in vast amounts. They built ponds for filling with sea water that through the sun-evaporation process left sea salt.

The long black veil (cobija) with which to cover one’s entire body and white petticoat were added to the tapis (overskirt) for modesty’s sake. Slippers embroidered in silk and gold rather than shoes or going barefoot when going out was common. In towns, native men used a frock coat, breeches, stockings, shoes. Tattoos were a thing of the past among Bisayans. Chocolate beverage made the Spanish way (not the Aztec style) had become popular and was served in “naturally small size” coconut shell cups. Cups, dishes and glasses of coconut shell were “finely carved”. The coconut shells were shipped to New Spain to be encased in silver where they were in demand. Palo Naga wood was carved into cups. To cure indigestion, one drank water turned blue by the wood. The Spaniards had come to like native “snacks” that would require “a large catalogue,” wrote San Antonio.

He found “men of 80 [years] working with the same vigor as men of 30... and many pass 100 before they are taken to their grave. This may be that they have adjusted to their [climate] since childhood; or it may be due to their prudent diet which does not change at all. The food they eat has very little fat in it and is by nature healthy. When he does get sick, one wonders at the very little medicine it takes to cure him rapidly, while it takes a Spaniard with the same illness an entire drugstore to get him well.” Even in the early 1700s the link between food and good health was recognized.

coll217,Little Meat,,2021-05-20,"In the early 18th century, the common native meal remained like the 16th and 17th century meal: rice with some small fish or shell fish that was either cooked, salted,or marinated. Being plentiful, islanders got what river or ocean protein was needed with a “minimum of cost and work”. Rice was flavoured with salt or sawsauan (used by some Spanish as the equivalent of “salsa,” sauce). “With this scanty diet (which is well liked by them) most of them manage to live and even grow fat.” There were also appetisers soaked in vinegar and salt. Fish and meat were dried in the sun or over a fire to make what they called “tapa”. Being preserved, the protein could be eaten little by little as needed. Natives ate little meat, either “because their stomachs prefer fish or they cannot afford it. However they do eat meat in feasts if it is given to them, or if they find it in the fields.” Deer, carabao and wild pig remained abundant. Wild carabao, being domesticated for agricultural use, was “stronger than a strong bull”. Spanish cow had been introduced from stock bred in Mexico during the late 1500s. Natives had acquired a taste for beef even if it was originally loathsome to them. The Philippine food heritage of rice and seafood traces far into precolonial times. Sustainable habitats for a seafood diet is a contemporary concern.","Cooking, Philippines; Filipinos -- Fishing; Filipinos -- Agriculture;",j san antonio,,,Detail of fish. Jose Lozano.

coll218,Selling Greens,,2021-05-23,"For 150 years records repeat that indios did not go into the raising of vegetables for selling to the Spanish population. Overseas Chinese workers and resident Sangley Mestizos did. Fr. San Antonio explains that the latter “did not exist at the time of the discovery”. Usually the offspring was from a Christian Chinese father and a Christian indio mother. They were “very hard working and civilized [and] make it a point to imitate all that is European, but they tend to remain apart. They live in the same towns of the Tagalogs, but they form a distinct group”. Pampanga also had many Sangley Mestizo. It is only in this era close to the 150th colonial year that the Sangley Mestizo became many and enough to warrant a separate tax classification. Indios could gather their food from wild plants still growing in abundance. They did begin cultivating pumpkins, sitao, bulay-patani, mustard greens, ikmo, bonga, and mongo. The latter was recognised as a good food for victims of scurvy; broth from it was used to cure smallpox. [Mongo could be sold to provision the galleon.] Apalea also called amargoso bore fruit to be a “codo” long (from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger) and was eaten as a salad and in stew. A wild tree yet to be identified with surety was called Col de Maluco. Its leaves were used popularly by indios in cooking.

There were many other social changes occurring and they all had impact on food security. A second change was the increase in the number of soldiers outside Manila to feed. Annual tribute was accepted in currency already, but only half the total. Payment in a rice quota continued so men working for the government could get paid their rice ration. Fr. San Antonio describes 24 fortresses and garrisons from Cagayan to Zamboanga in addition to the more heavily protected ones at Manila and Cavite. Some had only a handful of soldiers. Chaplains and military hospitals were also allocated a fixed amount of rice annually. Fr. San Antonio writes that every year over around 9,500 kilos of rice were allocated for soldiers of the Royal Service. Indios and not Spanish were farming. Although there were over 100 parishes (that also had the political status of pueblos), the interior lands of provinces like Pampanga were still wild and uncultivated. They were populated by wild pagans and vagabonds. The latter included men registered as parish residents but who ran away to escape polo — the required 40 days of labor on government projects. The work ranged from church maintenance, felling trees for lumber, and building ships to rowing during war. Those doing polo were supposed to be given a daily rice ration.

They had been given temporary use of royal lands but were to develop them and help Christianise the indios there. Agriculture floundered, the parish-pueblo was threatened, and population declined. In 1686, as the second colonial century started the estimated population calculated from tributes was “over 600,00”; in 1588 it was 673,600. In 1718 the King promulgated an order that returned encomiendas to his estate. He could develop them according to new strategies. As the 150th colonial year approached the native population recovered as did products from the lands they farmed. But they would be challenged by usury and usurpation of farmlands by friar orders.

coll221,Declining Galleon Commerce (part 1),,2021-05-29,"More changes as the Conquista was ending in the mid-1700s. Although indios were not allowed to invest in the galleon trade, the business offered profits from supplying provisions: salt, dried beef and fish, wheat and wheat sea biscuit, coconut shell cups and bowls for the crew, coconut wine, rice, mongo for instance. Only registered Manila residents could participate in the galleon trade. In its heyday an investor could earn 300 percent. The number of galleons allowed per year became limited to only one. The ship’s carrying capacity was measured and divided into shares. Since a limit also was set to the total value of trade goods going to New Spain (P500,000) and back (P1,000,000) each share had a corresponding peso value. Costs had to be shared to outfit the galleon, pay port fees and wages of the crew. City officials had allocations. Poor residents including widows found rich parties as partners. “This forms a kind of general assistance not found in Europe and its dominions,” concluded Fr. San Antonio. The colonials became so dependent on galleon income that if a ship did not return the colony’s economy was jeopardised till another galleon could be constructed, stocked and return home. Fr. San Antonio warned of another change confronting Filipinas during the first half of the second colonial century. Philippine commerce was on the decline and ministers needed to protect and grow the colony’s industrial wealth.

coll222,Declining Galleon Commerce (part 2),,2021-05-29,"Spain no longer had a monopoly on exporting Chinese goods. The trading company model managed by merchants was already in place among British (starting 1600), Dutch (1602) and French (1664). They were dealing directly with the Chinese. Manila was still exporting pearls and gems from India; rubies and cinnamon from Ceylon; Sumatran and Javanese pepper; clove and nutmeg from Maluco and Banda; Persian rugs from Ormuz; rich bedcovers from Bengal; high quality camphor from Borneo; Lequios musk; and ivory, rhinoceros or unicorn horns from Siam, Cambodia and Cochin China. China still brought to Manila silks, velvets, cotton blankets, porcelain, shawls, and curiosities of great price. Manila was still the transhipment depot that had started in the 16th century. The Chinese who shifted from paper to metal currency had no silver. Spanish pieces of eight paid for goods that were brought to Manila gave China silver. It is said that until 1750 (uncannily around the end of the Conquista in Filipinas) providing China with silver was at the center of the global economy. What San Antonio seems to have been pointing out is that Filipinas had rich natural resources ranging from gold and wax to civet, cacao, sugar and other food products. Yet Filipinas was not growing partly because there was no attention to agriculture. No one was investing in the colony’s production of goods for export.",Commerce -- History; Manila (Philippines) -- Commerce -- China; China -- Commerce -- Manila (Philippines); Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Economic conditions; Natural resources -- Philippines;,j san antonio,,,"Batavia, the capital of Dutch East India.

coll223,Southern Island Food Crops,,2021-05-30,"Fr. San Antonio summarised the major food crops growing from 1724 till around 1738. Samar: its plains are fertile producing an abundance of rice. Negros: fertile to rice “with which the natives supply Zebu and other islands around it”. In Cebu the “common food because there is very little rice” was a “seed they call borona which looks like millet, with a smaller grain and more straw”; also grown were garlic, onion, and a “lot of cacao, that of this area having the highest quality and being in great demand.” Mindoro was cited for abundant buri and yonote palms for sagu that is made into the “common bread”; it was not rice rich. The Province of Calamianes grew rice, vegetables, fruits; natives bred a “large number of pigs and chickens.” Mindanao produced an “abundance of rice and roots common [with] the Bisayas”. There was wild cinnamon and 25 towns on the coast of Cagayan, Dapitan and Samboangan cultivated the trees. It was mixed with Ceylonese cinnamon to acquire the export grade of “fine”. There were “beautiful and abundant wild vineyards of grapes”. In Jolo planted crops are not identified, only that there were many edible nests of the salangan bird; also perhaps for their eggs, many tabon birds. The Province of Caraga made salt and grew “rice for its own consumption” as well as good cacao, a botanical introduced to the colony only around 50 years earlier. There is not much mention of food crop diversity. Missions still were mostly along island coastlines (trying to be beyond flood lines) or inland along rivers; interior areas were still being Christianised and parishes created. New botanicals from the the Americas, China and other Asian sources would arrive mostly via missionaries who were still the only Spanish allowed to live and work among the folk for the first 150 years of the colonial experience.",Natural resources -- Philippines; Salt -- Philippines; Crops -- Philippines; Agriculture -- Philippines;,j san antonio,,,FSM photo of cacao fruit,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C7LsBJe7D36SbcTR7b3GW0hbYwjD_vdf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C7LsBJe7D36SbcTR7b3GW0hbYwjD_vdf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C7LsBJe7D36SbcTR7b3GW0hbYwjD_vdf,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPfenpNHZXQ/
coll224,Don & Pô Co,,2021-06-03,"Before winding up the chronicles of Fr. San Antonio it is important to glimpse some non-culinary changes he observed. One senses the mingling of Spanish and indio cultures in the early 1700s. Indios of rank had shifted from using the honorifics “Lakan” and “Gat” to the Castilian “Don”. He credited Tagalog for being a most cultured and formal language, citing its use of “po” and “po co”. The former was used by males, the second by females. It was discourteous to leave out either when speaking. There were many other phrases by which manners were still being well expressed. Children were being named after Pope Pio V and King Felipe V. Paternal surnames after the baptismal name, he wrote, “is now being introduced”. But men would forget their official names because once their first child was born, say Rosa, they would be known for the rest of their life as “Ama ni Rosa” (Father of Rosa). The custom was confusing for ascertaining censuses and tributes. These Spanish customs accompanied, as noted in a previous vignette, the start of men and women dressing in the Spanish way. As described in earlier stories about the end of the first colonial century, Spanish musical instruments and harmony were in place. Priests contributed food during fiestas when pig was served. Parishes became Spanish-like as they stabilized.",Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Social life and customs; Fasts and feasts -- Catholic Church; Tagalog language;,j san antonio,,,"Pope Pius V (1504-1572) who was known to be severe.

coll225,Pagan Food Rites,,2021-06-04,"Perhaps because fasting was a pre-colonial mourning custom called “sipa” in Tagalog, missionaries had little issue explaining Catholic fasting. During days of sorrow such as sipa one ate only vegetables. The pagan custom called “tibao” was still active according to San Antonio. On the third or fourth day at mealtime, “the best place was left vacant for the dead guest” while relatives would “eat and drink in a splendid feast” and recount the good deeds of the deceased in stories and songs. Missionaries were removing the superstitious feature and instead emphasising prayers for the deceased during tibao. Weddings had three days of eating, drinking, dancing and singing. A pagan practice that had been eliminated was for the bride and groom on their bridal bed, to each sit on the laps of old women serving as marriage sponsors. The women would hand feed the couple from the same plate and have them both drink from the same cup. The couple would pledge their love and guests would shout in gaiety, drink, dance, sing. The pagan priestess called a “catalona” would then rise and extend many blessings to the newlyweds. Customs were not uniform throughout the archipelago although there were similarities. The Catholic priest had to assert new church customs. By linking them to existing practices, the new rituals could slip into indio lifestyle. As other records note, the inclusion of pork, sweets and alcoholic beverage during fiestas aided mission work. Food was a tool of religious conversion.",Fasts and feasts -- Catholic Church; Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Social life and customs; Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Religious life and customs;,j san antonio,,,"A typical Franciscan missionary.

coll226,Steady Harvests,,2021-06-05,"Missionaries like Fr. Juan San Antonio whose chronicle we have been featuring could indeed take pride in seeing the results of their cumulative efforts since 1565. Not only were the numbers of indio and Sangley converts rising. Parishes were being settled, with a church, a government headquarters, houses along streets (still unpaved) laid out like a grid iron and each with a garden of edibles, plus chickens and pigs, even goats. Priests were proud to point out how well they knew their assigned venues including native plants that substituted for unavailable European ingredients. In early years, some priests worked in the fields side by side with the folk. They were “fathers” linked to their “children” and the farms, infrastructure, and successful growth of imported flora and fauna they worked hard to plant. San Antonio notes “pile”. Its seed looks like pine nut seed and substitutes for almond. “When green it can be eaten with its skin, like young almonds. It should be scalded with boiling water like raisins. If kept too long in water, it becomes hard and cannot be eaten.” A century in the future, pili would be made into Spanish turron and given as gifts with pride. Missionaries of the 1500s through early 1700s still were inspired passionately by the Counter-Reformation. Later friars seemed to have lost their desire for grassroots work as our stories will tell. But during San Antonio’s era, many missionaries devoted their entire adult lives to conversion and parish development. From 1598 to 1737 there had been only 13 Archbishops of Manila. Staying in position for around 10 to 20 years was common. The tenure of Governor-Generals was only around 3 to 4 years and did not build a lasting affection for Filipinas and its colonised.

coll227,Parental Dominance,,2021-06-06,"Perhaps missionaries sought to improve native cooking during fiestas and left the everyday rice and fish diet alone. Father San Antonio explains that the natives were ready believers of the new religion. “They are the most inclined to the Church and its feasts and ceremonies, but it is necessary to use the force of the whip to get them to hear mass on holidays of obligation and to confess and receive communion... They are very reverent to the Father Ministers because of the superiority they recognise in them, but at the same time make fun of them,” he writes. The indios were capable in any trade which they work at, he observed and “would be even more capable if they were less lazy or if their greed for temporal goods were greater. Because of this, they have always been, are, and will be poor, not caring to have more than is necessary to eat today”. Food accounts are interspersed among observations praising what the environs and era offer as well as perplexing evaluations that are patronising and condescending. It is within such a conflicting background that culinary changes occurred.

coll228,Royal Rice,,2021-06-07,"Tribute was payable in rice with husk on, called palay. The government rigorously established its measures. The CABAN, meaning storage chest in Tagalog, was an ancient measure that equalled 24 GANTAS. They were re-standardised according to the FANEGA, a Spanish measure of volume. In the colony, 1 caban equaled 1 fanega. But when polished rice, called bigas, was measured as the King’s regular subsidy for the Church and its missions, 1 fanega was defined as 48 gantas of palay that made 20 gantas of polished rice. “The King, in his charity, so as to give us the rice for our maintenance without waste [the husk], established the measure of [bigas] arbitrarily, such that it comes out double,” Fr. Juan de San Antonio, OFM explained. The old Tagalog GATANG or GABINAN was the amount of bigas for a “man’s single meal”. To measure a gatang was called TACAL. The gatang equalled one CHUPA. There were 16 chupas in 1 almud and 4 almuds in a fanega. So there were 64 chupas or gatang or individual rice servings in every fanega. One wonders if 20 gantas of bigas fed 64 servings. The 1 ganta measure of volume has been calculated today as roughly 2.5 kilos in weight of rice. 1 kilo can feed 12 persons. So 1 ganta can feed 30 persons. 20 gantas would have fed approximately 600 persons. While there was dependency on the Crown’s rice contribution, missionaries sought to maximise harvests of rice fields in their parishes sure that food shortages were annual.",Filipinos -- Taxation; Rice; Food portions;,j san antonio,,,"Wooden “gantang” for measuring grain.

coll229,Concluding Reports,,2021-06-08,"Unhusked rice was classified as either LAYA, the thicker and more substantial variety “more suited to the working indio” or MACAN, the “better” type that had fragrant SINAPAGA rice and the scarce, rosemary-smelling RINOMERO among its kinds. Fr. San Antonio said indios had a strong preference for fish or meat that was “somewhat smelly, which to [us] is a strange taste”. Iguana made a tasty dish. Frogs were “in demand by the Indian as food”. Laguna de Bai had plenty of swordfish. Large whales were found in seas of Jolo and Mindanao Island. Butuanons of northern Mindanao were “worthy of eternal memories and gratitude having been the first who gave shelter to the Catholic men-at-arms ... the first land where the celebrated Magellan planted the domain of Jesus Christ and that of our Catholic King.” San Antonio wrote: “The island of Zebu or Sogbu (which is its proper name) was the first one favored by God with the first planting of the Holy Tree of the Cross and the establishment of Christianity”. Mactan island was “where Magellan was unfortunately killed”. Other sites visited by the first circumnavigation armada were not identified by him. In the 171st year of the colony, the total indio Christian population had reached around 837,182; the number of churches totalled 700. There were no figures for the “fluid” Spanish population he said. Indios were acquiring Hispanic influences even if Spanish lay were not yet allowed to live amongst them. One may presume they were due to the priests who had become well entrenched. That civil officials knelt to kiss the hand of a priest seemed a sign that religion was more powerful than the state according to other authors.","Rice; Cooking, Philippine; Marine resources -- Philippines; Cebu (Philippines); Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Social life and customs; Spain -- Colonies -- Asia -- Religious life and customs;",j san antonio,,,"The food entries are in the first of three volumes of San Antonio’s “Cronicas de la Provincia de San Gregorio Magno” published at Sampaloc, Manila in 1738, 1641, and 1744 respectively.",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dcp-BcIne4iYZTY1SeMTDSRNGzzfg-Za,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dcp-BcIne4iYZTY1SeMTDSRNGzzfg-Za,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dcp-BcIne4iYZTY1SeMTDSRNGzzfg-Za,https://www.instagram.com/p/CP2HFj6nfto/
