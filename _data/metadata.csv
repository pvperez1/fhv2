coll001,Food to Sail Around the World,,,"Five ships were selected to be the Armada de Maluco. Their destination was Maluco, also called the Spice Islands of today's Indonesia. Trinidad was the flagship with around 61 men to feed including Ferdinand Magellan, the fleet's chief. San Antonio the largest by tonnage had 57 men, the Concepcion where Sebastian Elcano was assigned had a crew of 44, the Victoria had 44, and the smallest ship the Santiago had 31. Daily rations were computed for 237 persons although the actual number sailing is uncertain because manifests are not identical. The food was to last two years. The fleet left on August 10, 1519. They should have food to last till August 9, 1521. Only the Victoria skippered by Elcano returned on September 6, 1522. Only 18 of the original voyagers survived.

coll003,Holy Week Abstinence,,,"The expedition to the Spice Islands with Magellan in command experienced Holy Weeks in 1520, 1521, and 1522. Conforming to the Catholic rituals was important to the crew. Their lives were constantly in peril, especially from storms and hunger. The first Palm Sunday was 8 months into their provisions to last 2 years. They had anchored at St. Julian port in Argentina where autumn was starting in the Southern Hemisphere. The geese and sea-wolves they hunted as fresh food were penguins and seals, respectively. In 1521, Palm Sunday was at Homonhon Island, Samar form where on Holy Monday they sailed south. By Good Friday, March 29 according to Pigafetta's reckoning, they were in Mazaua (Limasawa) of Southern Leyte. Their Easter Sunday was celebrated with a meal of two swine given by Datus Colambu and Siauri. The meal was cooked on board. The last Holy Week (with Elcano now skippering the Victoria) found them somewhere in the Indian Ocean where on April 16 they headed north to Africa. Modern calculations identify March 26, 1522 as Easter Sunday. There was no feasting. The men were suffering inanition and catabolysis: the effects of extreme starvation. Whatever provisions they had loaded in Tidore, the center for clove, had deteriorated or been consumed. Their Philippine Holy Week, with Magellan still alive, was the friendliest of their foreign Easters.","Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Antonio Pigafetta; Datu Colambu; Datu Siauri; Spice Islands; Argentina; Homonhon Island, Samar; Limasawa; Mazaua; Leyte; Tidore",Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative collectible for the Quincentennial,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yiT8HJEDC_smQWC4_JNbfWIAv9WKlGCw,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM_ZNI7HlgC/
coll004,Too Little,,,"The Magellan expedition was one of discovery. It sought a maritime route from the Atlantic via South America into the Spice Islands. There was enough salted and dried food for two years that constantly needed replenishment of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, potable water, and firewood. Sailors recognised hunger, scurvy, and beriberi as enemies just like storms and shipwreck. Magellan sensing a long journey, decreased daily rations as allowed legally. In December 1519, four months into the provisions some men grumbled and asked to increase their food. Magellan appealed to their loyalty to the Crown and appeased them. He reminded that they had been finding abundant fresh food since they had left Spain. But the next year on the night of Palm Sunday April 1 , 1520 some officers mutinied! They seized three of the boats, then ransacked and distributed food to the crew hoping to win their loyalty for a trip back to Spain. They were 8 months into the journey. Two leaders were executed and two other instigators exiled to Patagonia. Forty of the crew were not executed because they were needed to sail the ships. One ship got wrecked and it seems its provisions went down with the boat although the crew survived. They transferred to the remaining four boats that stretched their food to accommodate them. By August 1520 the armada had reached the midway point of their stored provisions. In November of 1520, Magellan discovered the passage that led to the unknown Pacific Ocean. The San Antonio deserted and returned to Spain. Magellan should have had 8 months of food left when the remaining 3 ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on November 28, 1520. But they did not expect the vastness of the Pacific they were discovering for Europe. They survived by eating rats, the main yard cover made of ox hide, and sawdust from the ship's boards. They were unable to fish in the deep waters. The provisions had spoiled and ran out during the 3 months and 20 days it took them to reach Guam.",Ferdinand Magellan; Armada de Maluco; Guam; Spain; Spice Islands; Patagonia; mutiny,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Magellan coin.,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaEEX5x6r2OpEIjhH_KWtyq6x11gWm9p,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNB4DMRHEYp/
coll005,Out of Food,,,"Calculating exactly how many men arrived on three ships at Homonhon Island in 1521 is complicated. There could have been roughly 130 men for Magellan to find new water and food for. The peaceful strategies were firstly, to fish, hunt and forage at uninhabited islands or places where islanders allowed them to. The swine eaten at Homonhon Island may have been hunted there. No mention is made if they were carried from Guam. A second means is to receive food as gifts. The 9 men from Samar’s Suluan Island, the first of ancestral Filipinos to encounter the Spanish Armada, gave fish, 2 coconuts, assorted banana, and a jar of native wine from their supplies. One suspects the Europeans could not have fattened up in the 10 days from the time they secured food in Guam to the time they met the Suluans. The natives could have recognised the look of sailors who had suffered extreme hunger. The third means is to barter for food. The Suluans returned after 4 days with rice, chicken and other foodstuff which were paid for with beads, caps, textiles, clothing and other goods. But the ships carried only a finite amount of trade items and they were needed to purchase spices in Maluco, their ultimate destination.",Suluan Island; Cruxificion,Magellan Menu,,,CRUCIFIXION by Juan Flandes. 1519.

coll006,When Negotiations Failed,,,"When peaceful means failed to secure provisions, many sailors turned aggressive. Ships and villages were raided for supplies. Hostages were ransomed for food. In Cebu, Magellan required a food quota for chiefs loyal to Rajah Humabon. Humabon, the Captain’s blood brother, had pledged allegiance to the Spanish King. He was expected to assist the royal armada. When one village refused to give its quota, Magellan burned it. Such terrorist tactics were an underlying cause for the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu spurned the order. He fought to protect his people and their right to food security. Political competition among local chiefs was likely not his sole motive. Antonio Pigafetta was from the Republic of Venice, a rival in the spice trade. The passenger manifesto does not name him. It lists an Antonio Lombardo, Lombardy being within Spain’s Italian realm. He was among those added legally beyond the passenger cut off. A papal ambassador likely helped Pigafetta get on board for the adventure of a lifetime.",Rajah Humabon; Magellan; Basilica of Santi Nazaro e Celso; Lombardy; Antonio Pigafetta;,Magellan Menu,,,"The AVEROLDI POLYPTYCH.

coll007,Restocking,,,"Renaissance food preservation for naval voyages was limited to mostly dried, salted and dried, or brined foods.  Replenishing fresh supplies including water was mandatory for survival. Fresh foods the circumnavigation crew found in the Philippines included some familiar to them like pigs and chickens.  The domesticated varieties were usually prestige foods used in pagan rituals for thanksgiving and when requesting bountiful food, safe childbirth, and healing.  The crew of mixed European ethnicities also found familiar fish, crab, goat, citruses, bananas, honey, salt, ginger, garlic, rice, millet, panicum and sorghum. Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique would have known the foods of Insular Southeast Asia. Pigafetta from Vicenza seems to have tried coconut for the first time. He wrote of its uses as wine, vinegar, oil, water, milk and a substitute for bread. Although rice was cooked in a clay pot above fire as in Spain, rice was also cooked in a bamboo tube placed under fire.  He found cakes wrapped in leaves, some of rice and others of millet.  One rice cake was called tinapay, according to him. Other foods he and his mates may have found unusual were bat meat, turtle eggs and tabon eggs. He heard about a delicacy called Laghan Snails found attached to the hearts of dead whales. Like explorers over the millennia and even today, the Armada’s crew had to eat whatever would keep them alive.",Philippines; Antonio Pigafetta; Laghan Snails,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Coin,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1flU4XUNyBdiSRHXtqxqqJFaZCJpZALJf,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNRMIH1nxAR/
coll008,Pig and Peacock,,,"The special meal for visitors in Cebu as in much of Insular Southeast Asia was an all-meat menu. Pigafetta and comrades ate 35 different meats including peacock during a welcome meal sent to them by the Bornean Sultan.  For their audience with him, they were fetched by elephants. One wonders what was served at the farewell meal hosted by Humabon in Cebu after Magellan’s death.  He invited the crew and said he would give them the gold jewelry they knew he had had crafted for the Spanish King.  The new Armada leader wanted to secure from Humabon guides who knew the route to the Moluccas. The meal turned out to be a trap and almost everyone who went was massacred. Pigafetta had been wounded in the face by an arrow and was swollen, so could not go.  The three ships left immediately. One wonders if the Armada would have gotten to the Spiceries quicker than they had if Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique were with them. Magellan had likely reached Mindanao from Portuguese territories when he was still a soldier-sailor for the country of his birth. No one knows with certainty what was Enrique’s fate. Wanting freedom, did he plan the massacre with Humabon? Others suggest he was killed because he wore Spanish garments and would have been mistaken for one. Was Lapulapu in with the plot? No one knows for sure.

coll009,Nearby Brunei,,,"The Armada de Maluco, having escaped from Cebu, scuttled one ship in Bohol because there were not enough men left to sail her. Magellan died in April so did not experience the crew’s first stop at a Muslim settlement. It was on July 9 that several  canoes accompanying a beautiful prau with 8 elderly chiefs and musicians in it approached them. The prau decorated in gold flew from its bow blue and white banners topped by peacock feathers. Each of the two Spanish ships was presented with a wooden jar covered in yellow silk and filled with betelnut chew and orange blossoms.  Two cages with fowl, several goats, bundles of sugarcane, and three jars of distilled rice wine as clear as water were also given.  Six days later a spectacle of three praus with musicians playing drums and gongs came with foods made only of rice, some wrapped in leaves, some shaped like loaves, and others made like tarts with eggs and honey. The Armada gave presents to the 7 chiefs and herald in the group and sent through them gifts for the king, queen, and governor.

coll010,Courtly Food,,,"The Armada’s officials were allowed by Borneo’s Rajah Siripada to load water, fresh food and firewood. They presented gifts during an audience at court. When done they were served refreshments that included clove and cinnamon. The spices were known by Filipino ancestors but not noticed in their cuisine by Pigafetta. The Armada officials proceeded to the house of Siripada’s governor where they ate a full meal. Nine men arrived, each carrying a large wooden tray from the king. Each tray had 10-12 porcelain dishes filled with veal, capon, chicken, peacock, fish and other animal meat. All in all there were 30-32 different kinds of meat in addition to fish. Rice and sweet foods were included along with gold spoons like those in Europe for the guests’ use. Distilled wine was drank in porcelain cups the size of an egg. Pigafetta recorded nothing as elaborate at any of the courts in Philippine waters. ctto Vintage postal image of a peacock.

coll011,Life-Saving Clove,,,"On July 29, 1521 the Armada’s 2 ships escaped from Borneo! They feared being trapped and captured several Bornean trading junks. On one was Siripada’s captain-general feared throughout the region. He was the “son of the King of Luzon” and got away with the junks by bribing with gold the Armada’s new commander Johan Carvalho who was replaced subsequently. The prince would have been Muslim. The only Muslim community spotted by the Armada in Philippine waters was at Cagayan Island: a small population banished from Borneo. The Bornean experience served them well when they finally reached the Moluccas. On November 8, 1521 they entered the harbor of one Spice Island, Tidore. Its ruler Rajah Sultan Manzor became their patron. He filled the ships with clove, provided guides who knew the Laut Chidol (South Sea), and helped provision the Armada for its trip back to Spain.

coll012,Insular Asian Foods,,,"Pigafetta and the men of the Armada expanded their tastes of Insular Southeast Asian foods while loading clove at Tidore Island. Its leader Rajah-Sultan Manzor became their patron. Pigafetta learned of labu (possibly a wild cucumber), calama (rhubarb), itich (gander), ansa (goose). At Buru (the third largest island of the Moluccas) he recorded chanali (a delicacy of banana, Javanese almond and honey wrapped in leaves). Back in Tidore, Pigafetta discovered “wooden bread”. It was the sole (or principal) provision of island sailors he explained. He described it as made of “soft wood,” actually the pith of a palm covered in thorns. The soft wood was also known as saghu. There is no mention if wooden bread would be carried on the journey to Spain. There was no sea biscuit, the hard and double baked wheat bread that European mariners depended on. Their expedition had been teaching them about Asian food, psyche, and social relations. ctto Commemorative Lapulapu medal minted by the Philippine Central Bank.",Antonio Pigafetta; Rajah-Sultan Manzor; Tidore Island,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Lapulapu medal minted by the Philippine Central Bank.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_6t5FCUTH_dmPCOFXuKR94M9whX3ZXr,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN1YKphHtS4/
coll013,Extreme Hunger Notwithstanding,,,"In preparation for the trip to Seville, the 2 ships stocked bamboo tubes taller than a person filled with drinking water. They may have had goats, but certainly no pork since they were in an Islamic sultanate. Maybe they carried unripe bananas, coconuts, rice, sagho, dried fish. Only the Victoria would continue on. The Trinidad, suddenly leaking badly, would attempt to retrace the Pacific and South American route after making repairs. Meanwhile, the winds were favourable to sail west. On February 11, 1522 Victoria left Timor, the last island with fresh supplies. As they crossed from the South Sea to Africa, as Pigafetta wrote: because they had no salt their food putrified. If Portuguese spotted them, their clove and maps would be confiscated. They would all be taken prisoners. After 9 weeks rounding the Cape of Good Hope in tempestuous seas they reached the Atlantic Ocean. They had broken a mast and were leaking. Being in waters where it was legal for them, they stopped at a Portuguese port on Cape Verde Islands for food feigning they had been exploring Spanish America and were heading home. The ruse worked but not for long. Leaving 13 of their men still ashore, Elcano and all who had remained aboard sailed off to avoid the Portuguese sure to give chase. When the Victoria reached Spain on September 6, 1522 only 18 of the 237 original crew who began the trip on August 10, 1519 were alive. Of the 13 natives from Tidore who helped navigate only 4 made it. Sebastian Elcano, a Basque native, had brought the Victoria home. They had completed the first circumnavigation against all odds: an unknown route, bad weather, mutiny, warring natives, fear of the unknown, sickness, and prolonged hunger. Humanity was victorious. ctto Commemorative coin featuring the Victoria.",Victoria; Trinidad; Antonio Pigafetta; Sebastian Elcano,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative coin featuring the Victoria.,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zyki2UmHyYzdrnB-_B3I0Ir-yZiC2pXy,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN3lbT1HfBf/

coll015,When Bread Meant Rice Cake,,,"Tinapay, today’s Filipino word for wheat bread, originally meant “a certain kind of rice cake.” We owe that fact to Pigafetta who in 1521 listed words in the Cebuano area and their meanings. He did not describe tinapay so no one knows what it really was. Did he not encounter other rice cakes, what we call kakanin now? Missionaries of the later 1500s used tinapay as the word for host when explaining it to new native converts. In the 1800s, tinapay was described by the Recollect priest Juan Felix De Encarnación as a flour circle with a sweet filling that was folded in half to resemble the moon. Perhaps because it resembled the circular host, tinapay was selected by pioneering missionaries. They also used tinapay for wheat bread when referring to miracles of Jesus Christ such as feeding a multitude with just a few fish and bread loaves. Filipinos did not know wheat or wheat bread at the time. They were brought by the Spanish. Later “hostia” was introduced as the word for host; tinapay stayed as generic for wheat bread. Many words around the world change meanings in small and big ways.",Bread; Pan,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_0AM9OfDMEEoeEGDfNNcQ1TCXrwHIPXG,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3YIpd2nAJm/
coll016,Where did Pigafetta Discover Millet in the Philippines?,,,"In 1521 Pigafetta recorded that miglio (millet in Italian) was called HUMAS at the Visayan island of Mazaua where food included citrus, rice, coconut, and more. While Limasawa in southern Leyte is considered to be Mazaua, a case has been made that it might actually have been Masao, in the Caraga area of Mindanao! Historians are debating the evidence again. Millet was likely the fall-back cereal during drought when rice would not grow. Today humas is better known as KABOG, actually the word for fruit bat. It seems fruit bats eat millet and in northern Cebu’s town of Catmon, rice cake of millet is called BUDBUD KABOG. There is even an annual budbud kabog festival every February 10.

He had distinguished himself in the Portuguese military and maritime service, even reaching Malacca under Alfonso d’Albuquerque who sought to expand the Portuguese empire. Magallanes was no stranger to Asia when he got to the Philippines in 1521. He would have known bananas, coconuts, and other foods that a European crew could live on when food loaded in Spain ran out.

Roasting is an early, basic cooking technique. One only needs an open fire to roast. RP archaeological sites in Tawi Tawi and Butuan, areas within the scope of Pigafetta’s voyage had remains of cooked food, likely roasted, as far back as 7,000 years ago and the 11th and 12th centuries of the Common Era, respectively.

Pigafetta recorded that at the time there was not only roasting but, in earthenware pots, cooking. Perhaps the broths with fish or pork were made in them. But he also recorded cooking in bamboo tubes. Broths can be cooked in them as well in shells. Pigafetta preferred the rice cooked in bamboo to that cooked in a pot. He wrote that leaves were used as a pot liner when rice was cooked. In Cebu tagnáwan tree leaves were known in the 19th century to serve the purpose. One wonders if they may have been used because Pigafetta knew banana leaves but did not say they lined pots. In the Philippines the earliest earthenware so far found by the Philippine National Museum is 7,340 years old and from Tawi-Tawi.

coll028,Pigafetta’s Elephant Ride,,,"In addition to roasting and cooking in a clay pot, Pigafetta identified a third cooking procedure practised in 1521: baking. It is first mentioned as the way cakes of rice and millet wrapped in leaves were made. The cakes were part of the ritual to consecrate a pig for sacrifice. Likely the thickly wrapped cakes were baked inside mounds of hot ash, even the remains of fires used for roasting. (The beehive oven was introduced much later.) While sailing in southern waters he arrived at Borneo. On June 15, 1521 three praus from there brought foods including rice wrapped in leaves. Some resembled sugar loaves in size and shape; others were somewhat longish. There was also rice made in the manner of tarts using egg and honey. He was fetched later by 2 elephants with silk trappings to bring him to and from the Borneo king. The elephants were preceded by a dozen men carrying porcelain jars covered with silk and containing the crew’s gifts. Borneo is really close geographically to the Philippines. One wonders if it is true that the Sultan of Sulu had elephants, their 2 progenitors a gift from the ruler of Java that is also nearby. Dwarf elephants lived on Luzon 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago.

It is only when he gets to Borneo that he mentions being served refreshments of cloves and cinnamon. He finds the best cinnamon growing, though, on “the island of Butuan and Calaghan” and after leaving Visayan islands for good, finds cloves in 5 islands making up the Moluccas. But residents of the Visayas knew the spices the Portuguese bought. In Cebuano, Pigafetta records MANISSA for pepper, CHIANCHE for clove, MANA for cinnamon.

coll030,A Taste of Visayan Food,,,"The first circumnavigation crew would have satisfied their tastebud cravings the way Visayans did. One of Pigafetta’s most important observations is that the natives knew natural fermentation: coconut vinegar and alcoholic beverages of coconut, nipa, and rice. Before fermentation, tuba was sweetish. Along with honey, ripe fruits, and fresh sugarcane juice one’s sweet tooth could be satisfied. Tastebuds are warning devices of the human body, alerting when there is not enough or a surfeit of a taste that could cause sickness, even emotional imbalance. Sourness came from the coconut vinegar and native lemon. Salty was satisfied by salt. In fact Pigafetta found some dishes too salty. What could have been bitter? Charred meat as well as cinnamon and clove if they chewed on them. Maybe foraged fruits and leaves? Umami desire was satisfied by savory, “proteiny” cooked meats and meaty broths. No tastebud has been found reacting only and specifically to piquancy, so it is considered a mouth feel. Raw garlic and ginger provided the pricking to perk up a meal. Even if Pigafetta likely left out describing other culinary experiences, what he did describe celebrates how Filipinos used their surroundings to satisfy tastebuds, hunger and the dream of a good meal.

Other foods specified by Pigafetta are almonds, sweet and tasty pomegranates, watermelons, wild cucumbers, gourds, and comulicai similar to a large cucumber. He made a vocabulary of ""words spoken by Moro people in the area"" (also called ""A Malay Vocabulary"") noting they had only been there for the last 50 years having pushed the indigenous peoples upland to where the clove trees grow wild. In central Philippines he listed as food ""roots like turnips"" but he had no word for them. In the vocabulary he calls them ubi.

Certain filaments in the husk make a cord with which to bind native boats. Under the husk is a hard shell thicker than a walnut's that is burned and made into a useful powder. [Medicinal] Under that shell is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness eaten fresh with meat and fish as if it were bread. It tasted like almond to him; he explained it could be dried and eaten, too. In the middle of the marrowy substance is a clear, sweet, refreshing water. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. He described making a butter-like oil by boiling coconut marrow and water that had putrefied (fermented). When they wish to make vinegar, they let pure coconut water ferment under the sun. He learned to make coconut milk by scraping the marrow, mixing it with its own water, then straining it through cloth. He was told one tree could live to be a hundred years old.

One ate coconut meat chunks or rice cooked as solid as bread. Rice was the desired cereal, a food eaten in Spain and Italy because Moors from the Near East had cultivated it when they ruled Spain. Everywhere there was swine, goat, poultry, fish. One had to carry them live and slaughter as needed. The crew did not have salt to preserve the cuts while they sailed, he wrote. All around the region were coconut, banana, possibly also sugarcane. Praus bartered firewood needed for cooking on board. Water could be bought in long bamboo tubes that needed to be stored upright. One needed attractive fabrics, hats, clothing, glass beads, and metal to exchange for food. Otherwise one used kidnapping for ransom, storming small villages, and capturing laden boats to secure food.

It was believed the banana caused humankind’s damnation (not the apple) and that Adam dressed in its leaves giving it another term, CALZONES or BRAGAS DE ADÁN, Adam’s underpants. It is claimed Spanish knew the banana before the 1492 voyage of Columbus. Arabs may have brought the banana from its cradle of origin, the Eastern Indies to Europe.

coll037,Pigafetta Postlude,,,"Pigafetta's published eyewitness story about the first voyage around the world provides Philippine food writers with a baseline for ingredients and cooking procedures. His snippets also noted there was no great emperor lording over insular Southeast Asia; island kings fought each other even after intermarriage among their families; trade was an important factor for peace and political power; food was traded and given as gifts; feasting together could be a sign of friendship or a means to poison or hack away at guests. There was no campaign to make pagans Muslim. In Tidore, the crew killed all swine on board they had been keeping for food to please the Muslim King, their partner for securing clove and some nutmeg in the Moluccas. He gave them goats and poultry in exchange. It was known in the area and respected that Muslims did not like the looks and smells of pork. The provisions from Asia ran out. All the men on the carrack ""Victoria"" were starving as they reached Africa, but they refused to stop at Portuguese centres for food lest they be captured. The 18 who made it back to Sanlucar and Seville were emaciated. Their captain, Juan Sebastian Elcano (1476-1526), was rewarded by the king with gold ducats and a personal crest bearing the singular motto: Primus circumdedisti me.

He also documented that Filipinos made wine (tuba) from both coconut and nipa palms. Vinegar is wine turned sour, so maybe there was also nipa vinegar but he did NOT write about it. So coconut vinegar is the earliest Philippine vinegar according to historical evidence.

They may have purchased a wild jungle fowl (Gallus bankiva) some historians think. Pigafetta recorded the local word for “galina” to be monoch. It is spelled manok in the languages of Bicol, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Maranaw, Pangasinan, Cebuano, Samar-Leyte, Tagalog; manuk in Pampangan, Ivatan, Maguindanao; manu in Ibanag. In 1613, labuyo meant a wild mountain chicken in Tagalog. Filipinos have been eating chicken for millennia. Archaeologists of the Philippine National Museum found chicken bones at Butuan in Mindanao dating to the 11th and 12th centuries and at Cagayan of northern Luzon in Peñablanca that are 11,000 years old and Lallo, dated as 2,800 years old.",Labuyo; Chicken,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIP-MVGCBcktS7H5ZIbePIm5pm3WsXiO,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3A4_hkHzA0/

Easter is the major Christian feast. It celebrates how Jesus Christ died for the sake of his kind, people who believe in him and his church, allowing them life ever after. The native king sent Magallanes (Pigafetta’s boss) two swine for their meal. Thanks to archaeological work by the Philippine National Museum, we know pork was eaten by Filipino ancestors 7,000 years ago. It would have been hunted pig. The Ifugao of northern Philippines fault an overly curious Malimayu for interfering with a divine effort for zero hunger and that would have spared the lives of pigs and stopped hunting them forever. A piece of pork dripping with blood provided by a magical pig was suppose to give delicious meat always. That way only one wild pig would be sacrificed for the sake of its kind. But Malimayu was unfaithful to the instructions. She squeezed and wrung the pork till it had no more blood and died!

coll043,Drunk on Nipa Sap,,,"Pigafetta is the first to record a Philippine word for wine. In 1521 he wrote that the Cebuano word for vino (wine) was TUBA NIO NIPA. Tuba wine was made from distilling the juice of nipa, the only palm growing in water. The sap flowed from a cut made in a flower stalk (where the globular fruit would grow) conveniently located near the ground. A bamboo pitcher was hung on a joint till it filled with about 2 litres of sap that would ferment into intoxicating wine. Everyone drank too much almost everyday and slept so well that work was put off by Spanish and natives alike. Nipa, pronounced with slight differences, is the local term for “Nipa fruticans” in Indonesia, Malaysia, Antique, Cebu, Leyte, Panay, Samar, Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, Pampanga, Pangasinan. In other parts of the Philippines it is called sasa or lasa. Into the 1920s nipa was considered a most important plant from an economic standpoint. It was not only still popular as an alcoholic drink but as vinegar. Nipa has feathery leaves stretching 7 meters high and sprouts from a root growing in soil under the waterline. The palm grew in dense clusters hard to penetrate and thus served as a defensive barrier when invaders rowed upstream. In Pangil Bay, Mindanao there was a 9,000 hectare area where nipa grew! North of Manila Bay, mangrove trees were replaced by nipa. Today, nipa forests need replanting.

That is also how we many indulge in this book, a little at a time, appreciating the continuing flame of its traditional passion, Pinoy-style- in customary tingi, a nibble here, a nibble there, while already smacking our lips at the prospect of further dalliances.

Sardinella fimbriata, the round-bodied sardine, was called Lao-Lao or Tamban Lao-Lao commonly. It was a marine species that entered river mouths and was abundant in central and southern Philippines. It also lived in waters of East India, the East Indies and China. In 1890, Jose Rizal published from Paris an annotated version of Morga’s book. He ventured that LAULAU may have been TAWILIS. Today we know tawilis is the world’s only freshwater sardine and is found in Taal Lake, the current name of Bonbon Lake. The Lake was linked to Balayan Bay by Pansipit River, an actively navigated channel. An eruption in 1754, however, silted up the mouth and a narrower river eventually formed nearby.

By 1595-1603 while he was there, very few of the original conquerors who had arrived with Miguel Lopez de LEGASPI in 1565 to begin settling for Spain, were still alive. He documents chickens being eaten by natives and settlers. Food was always a challenge. What his book doesn’t include are documents from the Audencia where he worked requiring in 1598 that the city contract 19 riflemen-hunters to provide at least 1 buffalo for sale daily at the public slaughterhouse. Neither does he reveal that Chinese and Filipinos were required to raise chicken and swine under penalty of fine. The animals would form part of the settlers diet. Specified nearby towns were required to bring to Intramuros weekly 300 laying hens, a number of swine considered proper, as well as 2,000 eggs. The foods were not reimbursed by currency or barter goods. They were contributed in theory for the protection and organised governance the foreigners were providing. How were the eggs cooked?

One guarded the wine supply. Morga wrote that Filipinos made a local wine. “They drink that which drips out of the tender flowers of coconut trees and of nipa palms which are abundant and raised like vineyard-grapes although with less care and difficulty.” The juice was then distilled until fermented strong or light in intensity. He classified tuba as a clear fluid like water but strong and dry. It is interesting that he noted: “When used moderately, it is medicinal for the stomach and good for phlegms and other kinds of rhems. When mixed with Spanish wine, it becomes a pleasant liquor which is tasteful and wholesome.” Perhaps today’s competitive bar masters can develop a tuba and wine cocktail celebrating culinary mixing?",Wine; Tuba,Antonio Morga 30,,,"A Young Man Drinking (in the style of Spanish Baroque painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, 1617-1682) National Gallery, UK",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L3YMA9ZYP2nJaLpswChavCWeIeZnc-0v,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L3YMA9ZYP2nJaLpswChavCWeIeZnc-0v,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L3YMA9ZYP2nJaLpswChavCWeIeZnc-0v,https://www.instagram.com/p/B5j-9Y7nbbm/

When brined it is an aperitif and on a difficult galleon voyage offered comfort from sea-sickness and perked up poor appetites. In Filipinas olive trees refused to grow during Morga’s time. He wrote that in lieu of olive there was “a green, very small fruit, more diminutive than a nut, called PAOS.” He added: “when properly prepared for eating [pao] has a good taste when served as pickles or brined.” The fruit is 5-8 centimetres long and 4-6 centimetres wide. Pao or paho (Mangifera altissima) was common and distributed in forests from northern Luzon to southern Mindanao. As of 1921 paho was not cultivated. Neither was there ever a business in bottling or canning paho pickles or paho in brine. Perhaps those are reasons paho has become rare.

No one is sure how safflower got to Manila where is was also used to color textile. Safflower flowers were cultivated by Filipinos to sell as a substitute for costly saffron that did not grow locally. Saffron turned fish escabeche and rice dishes a lovely golden hue. Morga is silent about safflower’s culinary uses. He only writes that from 1595 to 1603 the food coloring was grown.

coll081,Husking,,,"Morga wrote that around when Manila City turned 25 years old, native women pounded rice to be cooked by them as part of daily meals that included boiled fish. Women raised pigs and chickens while men did more physically demanding work in fields or while fishing. They kept house for “husbands and parents” and did excellent needlework, spun cotton, wove blankets. Women were the home cooks. Important is the implied status of women described by Morga: When both men and women go to church or take a walk along the streets, they walk with slow dignified steps accompanied by male and female slaves who always carry parasols to protect them from rain and sun. The ladies walk ahead followed by their female servants and slaves, then their husbands, fathers and brothers follow with their male servants and slaves. He also noted that there was high literacy, with natives writing using what we call today baybayin. It is an indigenous script that was used as early as 300 CE. Examples are at the Philippine National Museum of Anthropology.

coll082,Fusions,,,"In the first 30 years of Filipinas as a Spanish colony, Morga described that colonials, natives, seasonal foreign traders, Chinese workers, and Japanese Christian religious refugees lived apart from each other. The Chinese quarter with its market, food sellers, and artisans is where exposure to Chinese ingredients and cooked food may have taken place. Intramuros had 600 houses where only Spanish could live; another 600 were outside the walls. Fort Santiago had only 30 soldiers and officers; 8 artillery men guarded the Walled City’s gates. There were at least 150 priests of the different orders living at Intramuros. Most Hispanics lived there with the only other places allowed being Cebu, Villa de Arevalo (Iloilo area), Nueva Segovia (Cagayan), Nueva Caceres (Camarines). There were few Spanish settlers and only a few years before Morga arrived was the colony given a budget for 400 pay-soldiers. Natives revolted and the colony was attacked by Chinese pirates and Borneans wanting to retake their trade route. Filipino food had not yet acquired Spanish influences due to few colonials and opportunities to experience their cuisine. New fruits, vegetables, and beef had been introduced as earlier vignettes in #antoniomorga30 noted, but they may not have been widespread yet.

Morga blundered the first maritime battle with the Dutch in 1600 that lost 137 of 200 men on his flagship. His valet removed his armour and they survived by clinging to a floating mattress. The number of resident colonials were far less than needed and those who stayed needed to be in fortified villages. Wives and children came with some of the career officials. How they coped is not recorded. But food was a challenge and it was natives and Chinese overseas workers who provided for the colonials. In 1603, when Morga was to take on a post in Mexico, the Chinese rebelled against unjust measures, burned half of Intramuros, and killed many residents prompting the largest exodus of Spanish who carried out a great amount of personal wealth.

coll085,A Nose For Food,,,"Around this time, March, Chinese traders who had arrived in Manila from December to early January would sail home happy with silver payment. Bobadilla writes, “Those Chinese merchants are so keen after gain that if one sort of merchandise has succeeded well one year, they take a great deal of it the following year.” So every Christmas season the Spanish were brought small oranges, nuts, chestnuts, raisins, plums, flour and more. A Spaniard lost his nose through a certain illness. He likely couldn’t smell his food anymore. He sent for a Chinese to make him one of wood to hide his deformity. It was so well done that the trader was well rewarded. The next year he brought a fine boatload of wooden noses. But in order to sell, writes Bobadilla, “he would have to cut off the noses of all the Spaniards in the colony.” Figuring out what new products the export market desires is a recurring dilemma even today. In a twist of events, the noses of Catholic statuary were chopped off during the Philippine Revolution that started in 1896 because they looked Spanish.",Chinese; Trading,Diego Bob 1616,,,"“Head of a Man,” Diego Velazquez, c. 1616 the year Bobadilla arrived in Manila.

coll086,Canon Fruit,,,"“Carne de membrillo,” flesh of quince fruit, is a favourite Spanish conserve from its Moorish past. It was carried by Magellan’s voyage of exploration. (See #magellanmenu) Quince couldn’t grow in tropical Philippines. Diego Bobadilla, SJ notes that starfruit, balimbing, birambi (Averrhoa carambola) could be conserved. It tasted like plum when conserved with honey (later sugars) and smelled like quince when ripe on the tree. “Birimbines” conserve was used on galleon trips back to Mexico. It was even ordered by residents there. Native to tropical Southeast Asia, possibly the Moluccas in particular, it spread to the South Pacific and East Asia, although when remains to be traced. ”Carambola” in Spanish means a canon, the sound of a canon, billiards and the sound of billiard balls hitting each other. Was there a military projectile shaped like starfruit? How and why carambola was applied to a sourish fruit with a cross section resembling a star could remain a conundrum.",Quince; Ferdinand Magellan; Carambola,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Illustration by Kaarin Wall in her book A JAKARTA MARKET published for charities of the American Women’s Association, Jakarta, Indonesia 1983 and 1985.",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KODlmzqCdExgK358WChduYN6jEej1ObY,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KODlmzqCdExgK358WChduYN6jEej1ObY,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KODlmzqCdExgK358WChduYN6jEej1ObY,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-OuckLnFZF/
coll087,Malesian Santol,,,"Bobadilla, who arrived in the Philippines in 1616, singled out not only star fruit (See DB3) but santol (Sandoricum koetjape) as exotic fruits made into “conserva.” New varieties have been bred with thinned santol skin, thickened flesh to spoon out, and increased sweetness over natural tartness. It has enough pectin making it good for preserves and jams. The Philippines, Borneo, Malaysia and Sumatra fall into one of three subdistricts of the MALESIAN biogeographical region which is why they have botanicals in common, like santol. Missionaries not only provide early informal references to Philippine food but scientific data for the 16th through 19th centuries.

coll088,"Conserves, 1613",,,"Three years before Bobadilla arrived in Manila, several types of native conserves were documented. Perhaps he ate all three. Calamay was a mixture of honey and flour fried in coconut oil. One also could have buchayo (pronounced boo-kah-yoh ) made of coconut or sesame seed. The terms conserva, buchayo and turron were interchangeable then. Four centuries later, pili turron was included among Philippine creole recipes. Turron means nougat. Introduced to Spain, and possibly first made in Jijona, during Moorish times it combines almond, egg white and honey. Bukayo was a common sweet served at the end of a Philippine meal before fancier options dominated. Foods are like fashion. They rise, fall, and may resurrect in their original version or as contemporary innovation.",Calamay; Buchayo; Turron,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Image from FSM Library: Bukayo recipe by Pura Villanueva Kalaw in Condimentos Indígenas, 1918.",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZpN-vS_QpfCp6em5jBdGlnKwZxkkbwX8,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZpN-vS_QpfCp6em5jBdGlnKwZxkkbwX8,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZpN-vS_QpfCp6em5jBdGlnKwZxkkbwX8,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Q8dQpH1ww/
coll089,"Sweeteners, 1609-1616",,,"In these bitter times, we all need some sweetness. So far we have enumerated since 1521 sugarcane chewed for its sweet juice, honeys and coconut syrup (miel de coco also called polot tuba). There are others for which there is written evidence. They were explained as the native “miel de caña,” sugarcane syrup the Spanish knew. But local versions were: polot panilan (honey from beehive); polot sasa (nipa); polot buli (buri). The latter two are palms like the coconut; the process of making honey from their sap is identical to that of polot tuba. Another important word in “sweet history” from the years being studied is BALÁS. In Pampangan, Cebuano and Tagalog it means crystallised syrup, granulated syrup. Syrups could have been from palms. The progression from syrup to solidified sugar and granules is easily imagined. In 1613 an active Tagalog word was PACASCAS. It was “curds like sugar sold in small baskets by Indios at the Parian [market] of Manila.” To a Spaniard “like sugar” probably meant like sugarcane granules. Pacascas is palm sugars. BAGKAT in Pampangan and Tagalog was likewise active: syrup cooked into a soft candy. When defining Philippine cuisine, precolonial sweeteners have an important role. Cooking with them today is one way of providing an antique, insular Southeast Asian, “native” flavour.",Honey; Syrups,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Pakaskas.

coll090,Sweet Salt,,,"During Bobadilla’s Philippine residence (1616-1648), he and other pioneering Spanish settlers could use honeys and native-made palm sugars. They probably rejoiced that Chinese traders annually brought what they hungered for: sugarcane sugar, once called “sweet salt” by Crusader-Knights who saw it for the first time. Sugarcane was known in ancient China but not till the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) was refining done. Around 727 Emperor Tai-Tsung sent a delegation to Magadha in India to learn how to turn sugarcane juice into much desired sugar crystals called “tang” in Chinese. From 766-779, a monk in Sichuan taught how to make rock sugar: boiling cane juice into a sticky liquid and letting it flow down a bamboo pipe into an urn where crystals formed. During the subsequent Sung Dynasty (960-1279) sugarcane became a top cash crop in Sichuan and the area from where Chinese workers in the Philippines came, Fukien. There were enough imported ingredients for Spanish to make some of their favourite homeland sweets: sugar, flour, olive oil, pork lard, almonds, raisins among others. But did they? Proof still needed. Natives outside Intramuros were still being converted to Catholicism, coaxed to live in a pueblo where a church would be built, and learn Spanish foods and customs.Two culinary systems for pleasing sweet desires were starting to meet. Priests and Chinese would bring in equipment from the New World and China to make sugarcane sugar during Bobadilla’s lifetime.",Palm sugar; Sugarcane,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). “Drawings of Plants from Moluccas,” c. 1805-1818. wikigallery.org",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uuCgEfi8Jpisgrrxs8Z5BL1LMO0qZs6a,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uuCgEfi8Jpisgrrxs8Z5BL1LMO0qZs6a,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uuCgEfi8Jpisgrrxs8Z5BL1LMO0qZs6a,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-YYAb1nqFy/
coll091,Cooking Camote 400 Years Ago,,,"Bobadilla in the early 1600s just like Pigafetta in 1521 records that rootcrops were eaten. He lists 4 cultivated ones. CAMOTE is a sweet potato, Ipomomea batatas. He writes it is the “potatoes of Spain” eaten by colonised and colonisers alike. There is APARI that a 19th-century source describes as white inside, nicely flavoured and called BARIBARAN in Borongan, Samar. UBI is an edible root characterised by a 1613 source as a hand-span or longer and white. A fourth kind was LAQUI. “Mountains furnish roots from which [natives] draw their most usual nourishment,” he added. One was PUGAIAN and the other COROT (Dioscorea triphylla or pentaphylla L.), a yam. Wild tubers were famine food, fallback when cultivated crops failed. Camote was often used as a generic term for all tubers, whatever their genus. How was camote cooked during Bobadilla’s time? He doesn’t say, however a few years before he arrived there is a document. LABON meant cooking a large quantity of tubers or meat. If it was a small amount of tubers it was as LAGA, in the juice or syrup of sugarcane (or likely plain water also). Cooking tubers in water was also called CQISA (gisa) but not referring to today’s stir-frying or complex stewing. Gisa then meant to cook rice, to make SAING that was done by cooking rice (or in this case, tuber) in water. Bobadilla has left insights into heritage cooking. Rootcrops remain healthy substitutes for emergencies and last long if stored properly.",Root crops; Camote; Sweet potato,Diego Bob 1616,,,Dioscorea alata. (Ube and ubi in the Philippines.)

coll092,Goat Horns,,,"Bobadilla noted that in common settings banana leaves on the ground [on the bamboo floor or over a mat, I suspect] marked where one should eat. Leaves were half a meter long and half that wide. Bananas recorded in the 1600s are saba, (healthy and good), bongolan (aromatic, green skinned), bangalan (aromatic, yellow, short), borohan (wild, lots of seeds, sweet), tanyanuang (very long) and sungay cambing (small, short, literally meaning horn of a goat). Some could be cooked in water. Banana originated in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. Arabs brought it westward from India. Varieties from the Americas (originally from Africa) would be introduced to the Philippines. Banana is a precolonial feature of Philippine cuisine to honour.",Bananas,Diego Bob 1616,,,Musa paradisiaca L. from plantgenera.org on pinterest.ph,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1do9dTR94cgKKKbpU63rlr8vxTsjmpDtd,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1do9dTR94cgKKKbpU63rlr8vxTsjmpDtd,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1do9dTR94cgKKKbpU63rlr8vxTsjmpDtd,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-YYAb1nqFy/
coll093,Banig Level,,,"Insular Southeast Asia is a floor-level culture. Spain introduced chair-level. Mat culture was so highly developed that there was a proper mat for each function. Some mats were specifically woven for heavy duty agricultural uses, others finer for everyday functions, and still others so artistically decorated with symbols and colours for ceremonies like those marking rites of passage. The banig is a precious element of Philippine culture to sustain. Bobadilla explained that while common eating was on banana leaves at ground level, the wealthy dined on low tables. They would have been sitting on mats as Pigafetta noted and the tables were low. Dulang is what Tagalogs call the low table that comes in many sizes. Several dulang can be placed end to end for large banquets. Important has been that one could eat with others.",Banig; Dulang,Diego Bob 1616,,,"“Una comida entre gente acomodada” from the Luis Ma.

coll094,Ship Loads,,,"Diego Bobadilla, SJ’s “Relation” covers 1616-1634. Natives used sailboats and CARACOA. The latter vessel had 3 layers of stations for rowers on each side. Manpower could reach 100 natives per boat. CARACOA were used as trading ships to carry dried fish, wine, salt, wax, cotton, coconut and other like merchandise in an active coastal trade. Spanish traded wax, storax, Ivory, bezoar in Borneo and Camboa. Two or three Portuguese ships from Macao brought silk, musk, precious stones and fragrant woods. Chinese traders noted in earlier posts brought persimmon and other fruit, parasols, porcelain, cloths the black ones used by Indians, paste gems, thread and the most esteemed whitest silk. Galleons larger than those in the Mediterranean were built at Manila where abaca was used for rigging. The galleon also transported missionaries. A subsidy was added for an outfit of clothing “they are won’t to wear,” a mattress, a blanket and straw for the voyage. Missionaries often lacked enough funds to cover meals while waiting for their galleons to leave Spain and Mexico. Part of their small royal subsidy ended up as handouts demanded at ports by petty bureaucrats. Burdens were heavy for Bobadilla and his brothers.",Sailboats; Caracoa; Ships; Trading,Diego Bob 1616,,,"Visayan Karakoa from Francisco Ignacio Alcina, 1668.

coll095,Bread & Wine,,,"Diego Bobadilla was made a Procurator. It meant he was to procure or draft Jesuits in Europe and bring them to Filipinas as missionaries. He explained fears that were real to the draftees: there was neither bread nor wine; the sea terrified; seasickness could keep them flat on their backs the entire trip; strange climate and illnesses could kill them. The Jesuit Pedro de Montes and his group of 20 Jesuits were assigned 3 ordinary cabins 10 feet long by 8 feet wide, and a fourth cabin slightly larger. A group of Jesuits traveling in 1625 had to lie with the feet of one resting on the head of another. Their cabin was a cubbyhole under the quarterdeck. They had to keep their ration of hard sea biscuit that attracted weevils beside them. Their door was so blocked with gear that they crawled into the cabin like cats. No one took off their clothes and soon vermin the size of chickpea attached to them, sucked their blood, and infested their food. At the stopover in Acapulco, bureaucrats refused to lodge them. They slept outdoors for 2 and a half months till they could make the Pacific crossing.

Then there was the Mexican layover of 5 months first at the convents in Mexico City and Puebla, then at Acapulco. It was then that they could taste Mexican cooking in the convents. The typical Pacific crossing was about 75 days. Perhaps because Bobadilla’s family was well known in Madrid and had royal connections, his group was assigned to the smaller of two galleons crossing the Pacific. The priests had a luggage room and the entire quarterdeck to themselves; Bobadilla even had his own room. The captain gave half of his accommodations at the poop deck in addition. They set up an infirmary on the portside for many who fell sick. They even fashioned a refectory on the poop deck using the passageway as a kitchen. Their comfortable quarters allowed them to follow their usual routine, offer religious instruction and service passengers.",Diego Bobadilla; Jesuits; Voyages and travels,Diego Bob 1616,,,"St. Peter Faber (1506-1546), co-founder, Society of Jesus. anastpaul.com",,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,image,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j9LChT06YFnHzvSDOFqD-pwGEyDW46XX,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j9LChT06YFnHzvSDOFqD-pwGEyDW46XX,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j9LChT06YFnHzvSDOFqD-pwGEyDW46XX,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qsXQ5nANh/
coll097,Culinary Adjustments,,,"When Bobadilla and his 41 recruits arrived from Acapulco in 1643 they had to go overland to Manila from Lampon (Quezon Province) where the boat landed. 100 porters arrived with Fr. Ignacio Mujica to meet them. With 8 litters for the sick, they walked up and down slippery rain-washed trails through the Sierra Madre till they reached Bai Lake. At one descent, 11,000 steps were cut into the path. At Pangil village on the lakeshore, a lay brother awaited them with a “hot meal of enormous proportion,” Horacio de la Costa, SJ recounts in the history of his order published by Harvard University Press in 1961. The alcalde mayor provided boats that sailed them from the lake down Pasig River to the Walled City where bells pealed in welcome. Recruits adjusted to their new island home and its customs. They learned not to fear the foreign. There was local bread made from Japanese flour at the capital. At their assigned rural stations they ate rice like those they sought to make fine Christians: using their fingers. In the first 100 years of mission work, fervent piety ignited men like Bobadilla. This is the last of culinary vignettes based on his documents. We tend to judge historical events forgetting that attitudes change from one era to another. How well did an era display the best of humanity? Did the Jesuits and missionaries of other orders exemplify a new ideal model for natives to desire for themselves? Did the new Christian food customs make sense to Filipinos?
